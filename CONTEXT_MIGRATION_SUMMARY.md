## 🎯 Project Overview

**TimeBack** is an AI-powered educational platform delivering "2x learning in 2 hours per day" through personalized, learning science-backed education. The current focus is building a marketing website with real-time AI personalization for 5 ICPs (parents, school leaders, entrepreneurs, government officials, philanthropists).

**Core Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** React SPA (Vite, Tailwind, Shadcn/UI) for dynamic content generation
- **Backend:** Node.js/TypeScript with PostgreSQL, Kysely ORM, Groq LLM integration
- **Data Pipeline:** ETL scripts for ingesting real student data from Alpha School
- **Personalization:** AI-generated narrative blocks based on quiz input + student archetypes

---

## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Database & ETL Infrastructure ✅
- **Database Schema:** Applied complete schema with 6 tables + materialized views
- **ETL Pipeline:** Successfully ingested all student data from CSV files
- **Data Verification:** Confirmed data availability across multiple grade levels
- **Memory Graph:** Implemented versioned data model per `memory-graph-spec.md`

### 2. Backend Service Architecture ✅  
- **Core Endpoints:** `/session/start`, `/personalize`, `/profile`, `/personalize/refine` working
- **LLM Integration:** Groq client with proper environment variable handling
- **Database Connectivity:** PostgreSQL pool with error handling and health checks
- **Service Layer:** Type-safe dashboard service for student archetype queries

### 3. **CRITICAL FIX: Kysely Type Generation Issue** ✅
**Problem Solved:** `kysely-codegen` package compatibility issues blocked development
**Solution Implemented:**
- Created manual type definitions in `backend/src/types/db.d.ts`
- Fixed Groq client lazy initialization to resolve env var loading order
- Implemented type-safe Kysely queries in `dashboard.service.ts`
- Added test endpoint `/test/dashboard/:grade` for verification

**Test Results Confirmed:**
- ✅ Grade 3: Ezra Vanlehn (Esports Tournament)
- ✅ Grade 6: Angel Muswege (Limitless Education - Malawi)  
- ✅ Grade 9: Valiant Leonides Lopez (Irvington High School)
- ✅ Error handling: Grade 99 returns proper 404

### 4. Data Coverage & Student Archetypes ✅
**Available for Personalization:**
- **Elementary (Grade 3):** Alternative education model
- **Middle School (Grade 6):** International perspective
- **High School (Grade 9):** Traditional US school
- **All schools under:** "Virtual 2 Hour Learning" brand
- **Geographic diversity:** US domestic + international (Malawi)

## 🔄 CURRENT STATE

### Backend Status
- **Server:** Running on `localhost:3001` ✅
- **Database:** Connected and functional ✅
- **Type Safety:** Manual types working perfectly ✅
- **Dashboard Service:** Tested and ready for integration ✅
- **LLM Client:** Groq integration working ✅

### Frontend Status  
- **Mockup:** React app in `/mockup` with UI components
- **User Journey:** Hero → Quiz → Personalized dashboard flow
- **Block Rendering:** Component system for dynamic content

### Integration Points Ready
- Dashboard service can provide archetype students by grade
- LLM client can generate personalized narratives
- Database has real student data for case studies
- API endpoints structured per `api-contract.md`

## 🚀 COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN COMPLETE

### ✅ **Documentation Complete**
**Comprehensive planning documents created:**
- `docu/archetype-implementation-plan.md` - Full technical specification with Phase 1/2 architecture
- `docu/canonical-archetypes.md` - Validated canonical archetype selections with growth stories
- Updated `docu/tasks.md` - Phase 1 implementation task breakdown
- Updated planning documents to reflect extensible approach

### 🎯 **Phase 1 Implementation Ready (MVP)**
**Next Steps:**
1. **Implement ArchetypeService** with canonical selection and extensible foundation
2. **Create PerformanceService** for MAP growth data enrichment  
3. **Integrate with `/personalize` endpoint** using real archetype data
4. **Update LLM prompts** with authentic student performance stories
5. **End-to-end testing** to meet <300ms performance target

### 🔄 **Phase 2 Enhancement (Post-MVP)**
**Future capabilities documented and ready:**
- Dynamic archetype selection with geographic/contextual matching
- Rotation logic for repeat visitors
- Subject-specific archetype preferences
- A/B testing framework for selection effectiveness

### 💡 **Key Architectural Decisions**
- **Extensible interface design** ensures Phase 1→Phase 2 migration without refactoring
- **Canonical archetypes** provide reliable MVP foundation with verified growth stories
- **Hierarchical fallback system** ensures 100% uptime even with service failures
- **Performance monitoring** built into architecture from Day 1

## 📋 TECHNICAL DEBT & CONSIDERATIONS

### Resolved Issues ✅
- ❌ ~~Kysely type generation blocking development~~ → Fixed with manual types
- ❌ ~~Environment variable loading order~~ → Fixed with lazy Groq initialization
- ❌ ~~Database connectivity issues~~ → Resolved with proper pool configuration

### Monitoring Required
- **Performance:** LLM response times (target <300ms server-side)
- **Error Rates:** Provider failures, database timeouts
- **Data Quality:** Student archetype matching accuracy

### Future Considerations
- Migrate to `prisma` for better codegen if schema grows significantly
- Add more sophisticated archetype matching (beyond just grade level)
- Implement proper authentication for production
- Add rate limiting and abuse prevention

## 💡 CONTEXT FOR NEW SESSION

**You are picking up where we left off successfully resolving the Kysely type generation blocker.** The dashboard service is working perfectly and tested with real data. The immediate next step is integrating this service with the main personalization flow so that when parents complete the quiz, they receive AI-generated narratives powered by real student archetype data.

**Key Decision Points Ahead:**
1. How sophisticated should archetype matching be? (Just grade vs grade+location+concerns)
2. Should we add more test endpoints before production integration?
3. How to handle cases where no archetype exists for a requested grade?

**Current Working State:** Backend server running, database connected, types working, ready for integration.
