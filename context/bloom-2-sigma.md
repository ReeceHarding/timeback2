The 2 Sigma Problem: The Search for
Methods of Group Instruction as
Effective as One-to-One Tutoring
BENJAMIN S. BLOOM
University of Chicago and Northwestern University
Two University of Chicago doctoral students in education, Anania
(1982, 1983) and Burke (1984), completed dissertations in which they
compared student learning under
the following three conditions of
instruction:
1. Conventional. Students learn
the subject matter in a class with
about 30 students per teacher.
Tests are given periodically for
marking the students.
2. Mastery Learning. Students
learn the subject matter in a class
with about 30 students per teacher.
The instruction is the same as in the
conventional class (usually with the
same teacher). Formative tests (the
same tests used with the conventional group) are given for feedback
followed by corrective procedures
and parallel formative tests to
determine the extent to which the
students have mastered the subject
matter.
3. Tutoring. Students learn the
subject matter with a good tutor for
each student (or for two or three
students simultaneously). This
tutoring instruction is followed periodically by formative tests, feedback-corrective procedures, and
parallel formative tests as in the
mastery learning classes. It should
be pointed out that the need for corrective work under tutoring is very
small.

The students were randomly
assigned the three learning conditions, and their initial aptitude
tests scores, previous achievement
in the subject, and initial attitudes
and interests in the subject were
similar. The amount of time for instruction was the same in all three
groups except for the corrective
work in the mastery learning and
tutoring groups. Burke (1984) and
Anania (1982, 1983) replicated the
study with four different samples of
students at grades four, five, and
eight and with two different subject
matters, Probability and Cartography. In each sub-study, the instructional treatment was limited to
11 periods of instruction over a
3-week block of time.
Most striking were the differences in final achievement measures under the three conditions.
Using the standard deviation
(sigma) of the control (conventional)
class, it was typically found that the
average student under tutoring was
about two standard deviations
above the average of the control
class (the average tutored student
was above 98% of the students in
the control class).¹ The average student under mastery learning was
about one standard deviation above
the average of the control class (the
average mastery learning student
was above 84% of the students in
the control class).
The variation of the students'
achievement also changed under
these learning conditions such that
about 90% of the tutored students
and 70% of the mastery learning
students attained the level of summative achievement reached by
only the highest 20% of the students under conventional instructional conditions. (See Figure 1.)
There were corresponding
changes in students' time on task in
the classroom (65% under conventional instruction, 75% under Mastery Learning, and 90+% under
tutoring) and students' attitudes
and interests (least positive under
conventional instruction and most
positive under tutoring). There
were great reductions in the relations between prior measures (aptitude or achievement) and the summative achievement measures.
Typically, the aptitude-achievement
correlations changed from +.60
under conventional to +.35 under
mastery learning and +.25 under
tutoring. It is recognized that the
correlations for the mastery learning and tutoring groups were so low
because of the restricted range of
scores under these learning conditions. However, the most striking of
the findings is that under the best
learning conditions we can devise
(tutoring), the average student is 2
sigma above the average control
student taught under conventional
group methods of instruction.
The tutoring process demonstrates that most of the students do
have the potential to reach this high
level of learning. I believe an important task of research and instruction is to seek ways of accomplishing this under more practical and
realistic conditions than the one-toone tutoring, which is too costly for
most societies to bear on a large
scale. This is the "2 sigma" problem. Can researchers and teachers
devise teaching-learning conditions
that will enable the majority of
students under group instruction to
Educational Researcher
attain levels of achievement that
can at present be reached only
under good tutoring conditions?
It has taken almost a decade and
a half to develop the Mastery
Learning (ML) strategy to a point
where large numbers of teachers at
every level of instruction and in
many countries can use the feedback-corrective procedures to get
the 1 sigma effect (the average ML
student is above 84% of the students under conventional instruction-even with the same teacher
teaching both the ML and the conventional classes). If the research on
the 2 sigma problem yields practical
methods (methods that the average
teacher or school faculty can learn
in a brief period of time and use
with little more cost or time than
conventional instruction), it would
be an educational contribution of
the greatest magnitude. It would
change popular notions about human
potential and would have significant
effects on what the schools can and
should do with the educational years
each society requires of its young
people.
This paper is a brief presentation
of the work on solutions to the 2 sigma problem. It is hoped that it will
interest both educational researchers and teachers in further research
and application of these ideas.
The Search
In a number of articles, my graduate students and I have attempted
to contrast alterable educational
variables with more stable or static
variables (Bloom, 1980). In our
treatment of this topic, we summarized the literature on such alterable variables as the quality of
teaching, the use of time by teachers
and students, cognitive and affective
entry characteristics of students,
formative testing, rate of learning,
and the home environment. In each
case, we contrasted these alterable
variables with the more stable
variables (e.g., personal characteristics of teachers, intelligence
measures, achievement tests for
grading purposes, socioeconomic
status of the family, etc.) and indicated some of the ways in which
the alterable variables influence
learning and the processes by which
these variables have been altered.
But not all alterable variables are
likely to have equal effects on learning. Our research summaries were
intended to emphasize the alterable
variables that have had the strongest effects on school learning. Within the last 3 years, this search has
been aided by the rapid growth of
the meta-analysis literature. In this
literature, each writer has summarized the research literature on a
particular set of alterable variables
to indicate the effect size between
control and experimental groups of
students. They have standardized

the results in terms ofthe difference
between the experimental and control groups divided by the standard
deviation of the control group.2
In each study, the reviewer also
analyzed the effect size under different conditions, level of school,
sex of student, school subject, size
of sample, and so on. Such reviews
are very useful in selecting alterable
variables that are most likely to contribute significantly to the 2 sigma
solution.
Table I is adapted from a summary of effect sizes of key variables
by Walberg (1984) who, with other
co-authors, has contributed greatly
to this literature. In Table I he has
listed the selected variables in order
of magnitude of effect size. (We
have added other variables and indicated the equivalent percentile for
each effect size.) Thus, in the first
entry, tutorial instruction, we have
indicated the effect size (2 sigma)
and indicated that under tutorial instruction, the average student is
above 98% of the students under
the control teaching conditions. A
list of effect size studies appears in
the Appendix at the end of this
article.
In our own attempts to solve the
2 sigma problem we assume that
two or three alterable variables
must be used that together contribute more to the learning than
any one of them alone. Because of
more than 15 years of experience
with ML at different levels of
education and in different countries, we have come to rely on ML
as one of the possible variables to
be combined with selected other
variables. ML (the feedbackcorrective process) under good conditions yields approximately a 1
sigma effect size. We have systematically tried other variables which,
in combination with ML, might approach the 2 sigma effect size. So
far, we have not found any two
variable combination that has exceeded the 2 sigma effect. Thus,
some of our present research
reaches the 2 sigma effect but does
not go beyond it.
We have classified the variables
in Table I in terms of the direct object of the change process: (a) the
learner; (b) the instructional
material; (c) the home environment
6
or peer group; and (d) the teacher
and the teaching process.
We have speculated that two variables involving different objects of
the change process may, in some instances, be additive, whereas two
variables involving the same object
of the change process are less likely to be additive (unless they occur
at different times in the teachinglearning process). Our research is
intended to determine when these
rules are true and when they are
not. Several of the studies done so
far suggest that they may be true.
Thus the ML process (which affects
the learner most directly), when
combined with changes in the
teaching process (which affects the
teacher most directly), yield additive results. (See Tenenbaum, p.
13 of this article and Mevarech, р.
14 of this article). Although we do
not believe these two rules are more
than suggestive at present, future
research on this problem will undoubtedly yield a stronger set of
generalizations about how the effects of separable variables may be
best combined.
In our work so far we have
restricted the search to two or three
variables, each of which is likely to
have a .5 sigma effect or greater.
We suspect that the research, as
well as the applications to school
situations, would get too complex if
more than three alterable variables
are used. In any case, our work has
begun with variables in the top half
of Table I. Perhaps as the research
moves on, it will be necessary to include some of the variables in the
lower part of Table I.

In our research with two
variables, we have made use of a
2 × 2 randomized design with ML
and one other variable. So far we
have not done research with three
variables. Where possible, we try to
replicate the study with at least two
subject fields, two levels of schooling, or some combination of subject
fields and levels of schooling. We
hope that others will take up this 2
sigma search and that some guideEffect of selected alterable variables on student achievement

lines for the research can be set up
to make the combined results more
useful and to reduce the time and
costs for experimental and demonstration studies.
Improving Student Processing of
Conventional Instruction
In this section of the paper we are
concerned with ways in which
students can learn more effectively without basically changing the
teaching. If students develop good study habits, devote more time to
the learning, improve their reading
skills, and so on, they will be better
able to learn from a particular
teacher and course-even though
neither the course nor the teacher
has undergone a change process.
For example, the ML feedbackcorrective approach is addressed
primarily to providing students
with the cognitive and affective
prerequisites for each new learning
task. As we have noted before.
when the ML procedures are done
systematically and well, the school
achievement of the average student
under ML is approximately 1 sigma
(84 percentile) above the average
student in the control class, even
when both classes are taught by the
same teacher with much the same
instruction and instructional
material. As we view the ML process, we regard it as a method of improving the students' learning from
the same teaching over a series of
learning tasks.
The major changes under the ML
process are that more of the
students have the cognitive prerequisites for each new learning task,
they become more positive about
their ability to learn the subject, and
they put in more active learning
time than do the control students.
As we observe the students' learning and the test results in the ML
and the conventional class, we note
the improvements in the student
learning under ML and the lack of
such improvement in conventional
classes.
One of our University of Chicago
doctoral students, Leyton (1983),
suggested that one approach to the
2 sigma problem would be to use
ML during the advanced course in
a sequence, but in addition attempt
to enhance the students' initial
June/July 1984
cognitive entry prerequisites at the
beginning of the course. Working
with high school teachers in Algebra 2 and French 2, they developed
an initial test of the prerequisites
for each of these courses. The procedure in developing the initial test
was to take the final examination in
the prior course (Algebra 1 or
French 1) and have a committee of
four to six teachers in the subject independently check each test item
that they believed measured an idea
or skill that was a necessary prerequisite for the next course in the
subject. There was very high agreement on most of the selected items,
and discussion among the teachers
led to consensus about some of the
remaining items.
Two of the classes were helped to
review and relearn the specific
prerequisites they lacked. This was
not done for the students in the
other two classes-they spent the
time on a more general and informal review of the content taught in
the previous course (Algebra 1 or
French 1). The method of enhancing the prerequisites was much like
the ML feedback-corrective process
where the teacher retaught the
items that the majority of students
had missed, small groups of students helped each other over items
that had been missed, and the students reviewed items they were not
sure about by referring to the designated pages in the instructional
material. The corrective process
took about 3 to 4 hours during the
first week of the course. After the
students completed the corrective
process, they were given a parallel
test. As a result of the corrective
process, most of the students
reached the mastery standard (80%)
on the parallel test given at the end
of the first week of the course. In
a few cases, students who didn't
reach this standard were given further help.
More important was the im- proved performance of the enhanced classes over the other two
classes on the first formative test in
the advanced course (French 2 or
Algebra 2). The two enhanced
classes, which had been helped on
the initial prerequisites, were approximately .7 sigma higher than
the other two classes on the first
formative test given at the end of
a 2-week period of learning in the
advanced course.
When one of the enhanced classes
was also provided with ML feedback-corrective procedures over
series of learning tasks, the final
results after a 10- to 12-week period
of instruction was that this experimental group was approximately
1.6 sigma above the control group
on the summative examination.
(The average student in the ML plus
enhanced initial prerequisites was
above 95% of the control students
on this examination.) There were
also attitudinal and other affective
differences in students related to
these achievement differences.
These included positive academic
self-concept, greater interest in the
subject, and greater desire to learn
more in the subject field.
In Leyton's (1983) study, he
found that the average effect of initial enhancement of prerequisites
alone is about .6 sigma (see differences between conventional and
conventional plus enhanced prerequisites and between ML and ML
plus enhanced prerequisites in
Figure 2). That is, we have two processes - ML and initial enhancement of cognitive prerequisites -
that have sizeable but separate effects. When they are combined,
their separate effects tend to be additive. We believe these two
variables are additive because they
occur at different times. The
enhancement of the initial prerequisites is completed during the
first week of the new course, while
the ML feedback-corrective process
takes place every 2 or 3 weeks during the course, after the initial
enhancement.
This solution to the 2 sigma problem is likely to be applicable to sequential courses in most school subjects. (In the United States, over
two-thirds of the academic courses
in elementary-secondary schools are
sequential courses.) This solution, of
course, applies most clearly to the
second courses in a sequence. It probably will not work as well with
the third, fourth, or later courses in
a sequence if there has been no
earlier use of initial enhancement of
prerequisites or ML procedures.
We hope these ideas will be further
explored in the United States as
well as in other countries. We

believe this solution is relevant at all
levels of education, including
elementary-secondary, college, and
even the graduate and professional
school level.
We also regard this approach as
widely applicable within a country
because the prerequisites for a particular sequential subject or course
are likely to be very similar even
though different textbooks and
teachers may be involved. Thus, a
well made test of the initial prerequisites for a particular sequential
course-Arithmetic 2, French 2,
Reading 2, and so on-may with
only minor changes apply to other
versions of the same course within
a particular country. Also, the procedures that work well in enhancing these prerequisites in one school
should work equally well in other
schools. Further research is needed to establish the sequential
courses in which this approach is
most effective.
Finally, the time cost of the initial
enhancement procedures is limited
to the class hours of the course during the first week of the sequential
course, while the time or other costs
of the ML procedures have usually
been very small. We hope that this
approach to the 2 sigma problem
will be found to be a widely applicable as well as economical solution available to most teachers who
wish to improve student learning,
student academic self-concept, and
student attitudes and interest in the
learning.
Our graduate students have written papers on several other approaches for improving student processing of conventional instruction:
1. Help students develop a student support system in which
groups of two or three students
study together, help each other
when they encounter difficulties in
the course, help each other review
in advance of taking tests, and
review their learning periodically. A
student support system that provides support, encouragement and
even help when needed can do much
to raise the level of learning of the

these and other cooperative learning efforts are almost as effective
as ML procedures. (Cooperative

2. There is evidence that
students who take special programs
to improve their reading and/or
their study and learning methods
tend to learn more effectively.
Ideally, such special programs
should be available at the beginning
of each new school level, that is,
junior high school, high school, and
so on. One would hope that the
special programs would be closely
related to the academic courses the
student is currently taking. (Improved reading/study skills-Effect

Improve Instructional Materials
and Educational Technology
The textbook in the United
States, as well as in most advanced
countries in the world, is an almost
universal part of school instruction.
There has been much work on the
improvement of the textbooks for
reading and, to some extent, arithmetic, mathematics, and science
subjects. Most of these are in relation to special curricular improvements, which include improvements
in the sequential nature of the
topics, the attempt to find important ideas or schema that help to interrelate the different parts of the
subject, and improvements in the illustrations and exercises in the
books. However, as far as we can
find, these improvements have not
had very significant effects on student achievement unless the teachers were provided with much inservice education for the new curriculum or the new textbook.
My graduate students and I have
been intrigued by the possibility
that the organization of a particular
section (or chapter) of the textbook
might be better integrated or the
parts of the section more closely
related to each other. Preorganizers or advanced organizers
(Ausubel, 1960), have been
moderately effective when provided in the textbook or provided by
the teacher at the beginning of the
new unit of the course. These may
June/July 1984
be provided in the form of objесtives, some ideas about what will be
learned in the unit, or a brief discussion of the relation between what
has already been learned and what
will be learned in the unit. Such advanced organizers (Luiten, Ames, &
Ackerson, 1980) appear to have an
average effect size on achievement
of about .2 sigma. (Incidentally,
such advance organizers have about
a .4 sigma effect on retention of the
learning.) Although this effect is
rather consistent, by itself it is not
enough to contribute significantly to
the 2 sigma effect. It is likely that
a combination of advance
organizers at the beginning of a
new topic, further organizational
aids during the chapter or unit, as
well as appropriate questions, summaries, or other organizational aids
at the end of the unit, may have a
substantial effect on the student's
learning of that chapter.
In Process
One of our students, Carlos
Avalos, is working on a study of the
effect of organizational aids in the
instructional material combined
with the initial enhancement of
cognitive prerequisites and the ML
feedback-corrective procedures.
Avalos is planning a research
design that will enable him to determine the separate effects of each of
the three processes, the effect of
any two of the processes, and the
combined effect of all three processes. At the least, it is anticipated
that the combination of any two of
the processes will be greater than
the effects of any one of the same
processes. It is hoped that the effect
of any two will be above 1.3 sigma
(90 percentile). If this is found, it
will provide several new solutions to
the 2 sigma problem-some of
which can be done with very little
cost or effort by the teachers or the
school system.
Avalos expects the results noted
above because the organizational
aids can be built into new textbooks
and can be used by the students
with a minimum of emphasis by the
teachers. The initial enhancement
of the prerequisites is completed
before the students begin the study
of the new course subject matter,
whereas the ML feedback-corrective procedures take place every 2
or 3 weeks during the course. We
believe that each of these processes
is somewhat independent of the
other processes.
Other suggestions for the improvement of instructional materials
and educational technology include
the following:
1. Some of our students have
used computer learning courses,
such as the Plato system, which appear to work very well for highly
motivated students. We believe that
it should be possible to determine
whether particular computer
courses enable sizeable proportions
of students to attain the 2 sigma
achievement effect. The effectiveness of the computer courses
can be determined in terms of the
time required, completion rates,
student performance on achievement tests, and student retention of
the learned material. It is hoped
that the more effective computer
courses will also have positive effects on such affective characteristics as academic self-concept, interest in the subject, and desire to
learn further with computer learning methods.
2. Although the average effect
size for new science and math curricula in the United States is only
.3 sigma, some of the new curricula
(or textbooks) in these and other
subjects may be much more effective than others. We propose a
careful search of the new curricula
and textbooks to determine which
ones are more effective and to
determine what characteristics
make them more effective than the
others.
Home Environment
and the Peer Group
In this section, we are primarily
concerned with the out-of-school
support that the student receives
from the home or the peer group.
We are interested in the ways in
which the student's achievement,
academic aspirations and goals, and
progress in learning are influenced
by these types of support. We know
that the home environment does
have great influence on the pupil's
school learning and that this influence is especially effective at the
elementary school level or earlier.
The peer group's influence is likely
to be strongest (both positively or

negatively) at the secondary school
level.
Home Environment Processes
There have been a large number
of studies of the home environment
processes that affect the students'
school learning. These studies involve interviews and observations
directed at determining the relevant interactions between parents
and their children. The studies find
correlations of +.70 to +.803 between an index of the home environment processes and the children's
school achievement. Some of the
home environment processes that
appear to have high relationships
with school achievement include the
following:
1. Work habits of the family-the
degree of routine in the home management, the emphasis on regularity in the use of space and time, and
the priority given to schoolwork
over other more pleasurable
activities.
2. Academic guidance and support-the availability and quality of
the help and encouragement
parents give the child for his or her
schoolwork and the conditions they
provide to support the child's
schoolwork.
3. Stimulation in the home-the
opportunity provided by the home
to explore ideas, events, and the
larger environment.
4. Language development-орportunities in the home for the
development of correct and effective language usage.
5. Academic aspirations and expectations-the parents' aspirations
for the child, the standards they set
10
for the child's school achievement,
and their interests in and
knowledge of the child's school
experiences.
These studies of the home environment processes began with the
work of Dave (1963) and Wolf
(1964, 1966), and since then have
been replicated in other studies
done in the United States and other
countries (Marjoribanks, 1974;
Kalinowski & Sloane, 1981).
These previous studies of the relationship between the home and the
children's school achievement suggest a strong effect of the home environment on the school learning of
the children, but they do not provide evidence on the extent to which
the home environment can be
altered and the effect of such alteration on changes in the children's
school achievement.
A recent study done in Thailand
by Janhom (1983) involved a control
group and three experimental
groups of parents (and their
children). In this study, the most effective treatment of the parents
was for the group of parents to
meet with a parent educator for
about 2 hours twice a month for 6
months. In these meetings, the
parents discussed ways in which
they could support their children's
learning in the school. There was
usually an initial presentation made
by the parent educator on one of the
home environment processes and
then the parents discussed what
they did as well as what they hoped
to do to support their children's
school learning.
Another experimental approach
included visits to each home
separately by a parent educator
twice a month for 6 months. A third
experimental approach was that
newsletters about the same topics
were sent to the home twice a
month for 6 months.
The parents of all four groups
were observed and interviewed at
the beginning and end of the
6-month period using the Dave
(1963) interview and observational
methods. Although the three experimental approaches show significantly greater changes in the parents' home environment index than
the control group, the most effective method was the series of meetings between groups of parents and
the parent educator. The changes in
the home environment of this group
were highly significant when compared with the changes in the other
three groups of parents.
The fourth grade children of all
these parents were given a national
standardized test on reading and
mother tongue as well as arithmetic
at the beginning and end of the
6-month period. It was found that
the children of the meeting group of
parents had changed by 1 sigma in
achievement, as contrasted with the
change in the control group of children. In comparison, the parent
educators' visit to each of the homes
every other week had only a .5 sigma effect on the children's school
achievement.
Other methods of changing the
home environment have been reported by Dolan (1980), Bronfenbrenner (1974), and Kalinowski and
Sloane (1981). Again, the most effective approaches to changing the
home environment processes result
in changes in the children's school
achievement. (Home Environment
- Effect size .50 (69 percentile),
Iverson & Walberg, 1982.)
The methods of changing the
home environments are relatively
costly in terms of parent educators
meeting with groups of parents
over a series of semi-monthly meetings, but the payoff of this approach
is likely to be very great. If parents
continue to encourage and support
each of their children to learn well
in school throughout the elementary
school years, this should greatly help the children during the years
they will attend schools and
colleges.
Educational Researcher
Although such research has not
been done as yet, we hope that
others will explore an approach to
the 2 sigma problem of providing effective parent education combined
with the mastery learning method.
Because parent support takes place
in the home and ML takes place in
the school, we expect that these two
effects will be additive. The result
should be close to a 2 sigma improvement in student learning.
Ideally, if both methods began
with first or second grade children,
one might hope that the combination would result in consistently
good learning, at least through the
elementary school years, with less
and less need for effort expended by
the parents or by the use of ML procedures in the school.
Peer Group
During the adolescent years, it is
likely that the peer group will have
considerable influence on the student's activities, behavior, attitudes, and academic expectations.
The peer group(s) to which the individual "belongs" also has some effect on the student's high school
achievement level as well as further
academic aspirations. These effects
appear to be greatest in urban settings. Although it is difficult to influence the student's choice of
friends and peer groups, the availability in the school of a variety of
extracurricular activities and clubs
(e.g., athletics, music, science,
mathematics, social, etc.) should enable students to be more selective
in their peer choices within the
school setting. (Peer Group Influence-Effect size .20 (58 percentile)
(Ide, Haertel, Parkerson, & Walberg, 1981).
Improvement of Teaching
When we compare student learning under conventional instruction
and tutoring we note that approxіmately 20% of the students under
conventional instruction do about as
well as the tutored students. (See
Figure 1). That is, tutoring probably
would not enable these top students
to do any better than they already
do under conventional instruction.
In contrast, about 80% of the students do relatively poorly under
conventional instruction as compared with what they might do unJune/July 1984
Teachers are frequently unaware of the fact that they
are providing more favorable conditions of learning for
some students than they are for other students. Generally, they are under the impression that all students in
their classes are given equality of opportunity for
learning.
der tutoring. We have pondered
these facts and believe that this in
part results from the unequal treatment of students within most classrooms.
Observations of teacher interaction with students in the classroom
reveal that teachers frequently
direct their teaching and explanations to some students and ignore
others. They give much positive
reinforcement and encouragement
to some students but not to others,
and they encourage active participation in the classroom from
some students and discourage it
from others. The studies find that
typically teachers give students in
the top third of the class the
greatest attention and students in
the bottom third of the class receive
the least attention and support.
These differences in the interaction
between teachers and students provide some students with much
greater opportunity and encouragement for learning than is provided
for other students in the same classroom (Brophy & Good, 1970.)
It is very different in a one-to-one
tutoring situation where there is a
constant feedback and corrective
process between the tutor and the
tutee. If the explanation is not
understood by the tutee, the tutor
soon becomes aware of it and explains it further. There is much reinforcement and encouragement in
the tutoring situation, and the tutee
must be actively participating in the
learning if the tutoring process is to
continue. In contrast, there is less
feedback from each student in the
group situation to the teacher-and
frequently the teacher gets most of
the feedback on the clarity of his or
her explanations, the effect of the
reinforcements, and the degree of
active involvement in the learning
from a small number of high achieving students in the typical class of
30 students.
Teachers are frequently unaware
of the fact that they are providing
more favorable conditions of learning for some students than they are
for other students. Generally, they
are under the impression that all
students in their classes are given
equality of opportunity for learning.
One basic assumption of our work
on teaching is the belief that when
teachers are helped to secure a
more accurate picture of their own
teaching methods and styles of interaction with their students, they
will increasingly be able to provide
more favorable learning conditions
for more of their students, rather
than just for the top fraction of the
class.
In some of our research on the 2
sigma problem, we have viewed the
task of teaching as providing for
more equal treatment of students.
We have been trying to give teachers feedback on their differential
treatment of students. We attempt
to provide teachers with a mirror of
what they are now doing and have
them develop techniques for
equalizing their interactions with
the students. These include such
techniques as: (a) attempt to find
something positive and encouraging
in each student's response, (b) find
ways of involving more of the
students in active engagement in
the learning process, (c) secure
feedback from a small random sam11

ple of students to determine when
they comprehend the explanations
and illustrations, and (d) find ways
of supplying additional clarification
and illustrations as needed. The major emphasis in this work was not
to change the teachers' methods of
instruction, but to have the teacher
become more aware of the ways in
which he or she could more directly
teach to a cross section of the students at each class section.
The first of our studies on improving instruction was done by Nordin
(1979, 1980), who found ways of improving the cues and explanations
for students as well as increasing
the active participation of students.
He found it helpful to meet frequently with the teachers to explain
these ideas as well as to observe the
teachers and help them determine
when they still needed to improve
these qualities of the instruction. He
also had independent observers noting the frequency with which the
experimental teachers were using
these ideas well or poorly. Similarly, he had students note the frequency with which they were aсtively participating in the learning
and any problems they had with understanding the ideas or explanations.
In this research he compared student learning under conventional
instruction and under enhanced
cues (explanations) and participation conditions. During the experiment, observers noted that the student participation and the explanations and directions were positive in
about 57% of the observations in
the control class as compared with
about 67% in the enhanced cue +
participation classes. Students in
the control classes noted that the
cues and participation were positive
for them about 50% of the time as
compared with about 80% of the
time for the students in the enhanced cue + participation classes.
In terms of final achievement, the
average student in the enhanced
cue and participation group was 1.5
sigma higher than the average student in the control classes. (The
average student in the enhanced
group was above 93% of the students in the control classes.) (See
Figure 3.) Nordin (1979, 1980) also
made use of the ML procedures in
other classes and found that they
worked even better than the enhanced cue + participation procedures. Unfortunately, he did not use
the ML in combination with the enhanced cue + participation
methods.
In any case, Nordin (1979, 1980)
did demonstrate that teachers could
be taught ways to be more responsive to most of the students in the
class, secure increased participation
of the students, and insure that

most of the students understood the
explanations and illustrations that
the teacher provided. The observers
noted that the students in the
enhanced participation and cue
classes were actively engaged in
learning (time on task) about 75%
of the classroom time, whereas the
control students were actively
learning only about 57% of the time.
In a later study, Tenenbaum
(1982) compared control groups,
ML groups, and Enhanced Cues,
Participation, and Reinforcement in
combination with ML (CPR + ML).
Tenenbaum studied these three
methods of teaching with randomly assigned students in two different courses-sixth grade science
and ninth grade algebra.
Tenenbaum also used student observation of their own classroom
processes on cues, participation,
and reinforcement. He found that
under the CPR + ML, students
responded positively about their
own participation about 87% of the
time as contrasted with 68% in the
control classes.
The results of this study demonstrated large differences between
the three methods of instruction
with the final achievement scores of
the CPR + ML group about 1.7
sigmas above the control students
(the average student in this group
was above 96% of the students in
the control group.) The average student in the ML groups was the
usual 1 sigma above the control students. (See Figure 3).
We believe that this research
makes it clear that teachers in both
the Nordin and Tenenbaum studies
could (at least temporarily) change
their teaching methods to provide
more equal treatment of the students in their classes. When this
more equal treatment is provided
and supplemented with the ML
feedback and corrective procedures,
the average student approaches the
level of learning found under tutoring methods of instruction.
We believe there are a variety of
methods of giving feedback to
teachers on the extent to which they
are providing equality of interaction
with their students. The tactic of
providing a "mirror" to the teacher
of the ways in which he or she is
providing cues and explanations,
appropriate reinforcement, and
June/July 1984
securing overt as well as covert participation of the students in the
learning, seems to us to be an excellent approach. This may be in the
form of an observer's notes on what
the teacher and students did, student observations of their own interactions with the teaching
(preferably anonymous, but coded
as to whether the students are in
the top third, middle third, or the
bottom third of the class in achievement), such as their understanding
of the cues and explanations, the eхtent of their overt & covert participation, and the amount of reinforcement they are getting. Perhaps a video-tape or audio tape recording of the class could serve the
same purpose if the teacher is given
brief training on ways of summarizing the classroom interaction between the teacher and the students
in the class.
It is our hope that when teachers
are helped to secure a more accurate picture of their own teaching
methods and styles of interaction
with their students, they will be better able to provide favorable learning conditions for most of their students.
Improvement of Teaching of
the Higher Mental Processes
In these countries, subjects are
taught as methods of inquiry into
the nature of science, mathematics,
the arts, and the social studies. The
subjects are taught as much for the
ways of thinking they represent as
for their traditional content. Much
of this learning makes use of observations, reflections on these observations, experimentation with phenomena, and the use of first hand
data and daily experiences, as well
as the use of primary printed
sources. All of this is reflected in the
materials of instruction, the learning and teaching processes used,
and the questions and problems
used in the quizzes and formative
testing, as well as on the final summative examinations.
In sharp contrast with some of
these other countries, teachers in
the United States typically make
use of textbooks that rarely pose
real problems. These textbooks emphasize specific content to be
remembered and give students little opportunity to discover underlying concepts and principles and
even less opportunity to attack real
problems in the environments in
which they live. The teacher-made
tests (and standardized tests) are
largely tests of remembered information. After the sale of over one
Although there is much of rote million copies of the Тахопоту of
learning in schools through the
world, in some of the national curriculum centers in different countries (e.g., Israel, Malaysia, South
Korea) I find great emphasis on
problem-solving, application of principles, analytical skills, and creativity. Such higher mental processes
are emphasized because these centers believe that they enable the student to relate his or her learning to
the many problems he or she
encounters in day-to-day living.
These abilities are also stressed
because they are retained and used
long after the individual has forgotten the detailed specifics of the subject matter taught in the schools.
These abilities are regarded as one
set of essential characteristics needed to continue learning and to cope
with a rapidly changing world.
Some curriculum centers believe
that these higher mental processes
are important because they make
learning exciting and constantly
new and playful.
Educational Objectives-Cognitive
Domain (Bloom, Engelhart, Furst,
Hill, & Krathwohl, 1956) and over
a quarter of a century of use of this
domain in preservice and in-service
teacher training, it is estimated that
over 90% of test questions that U.S.
public school students are now expected to answer deal with little
more than information. Our instructional material, our classroom
teaching methods, and our testing
methods rarely rise above the lowest category of the Taxonomyknowledge.
In the tutoring studies reported
at the beginning of this paper, it
was found that the tutored students' Higher Mental Process
(HMP) achievement was 2.0 sigma
above the control students. (See
Figure 4.) (The average tutored student was above 98% of the control
students on the HMP part of the
summative examination.) It should
be noted that in these studies higher

mental process questions were included in the formative tests used
in the feedback-corrective processes
for both the ML and tutored groups.
Again, the point is that students can
learn the higher mental processes if
they become more central in the
teaching-learning process.
Several studies have been made in
which the researcher was seeking to
improve the higher mental processes.
We have already referred to the
Tenenbaum (1982) study, which emphasized changing teacher-student
interaction. In this study, the CueParticipation-Reinforcement +
Mastery Learning student group
was 1.7 sigma higher than the control students on the higher mental
process part of the summative examination. (The average CPR +
ML student was above 96% of the
control students on the higher mental processes.) (See Figure 4.)
Another study done by Levin
(1979) was directed to improving
the higher mental processes by emphasizing the mastery of the lower
mental processes and providing
14
learning experiences in which the
students applied principles in a
variety of different problem situations. On the summative examinations, the students were very high
on the knowledge of principles and
facts and in their ability to apply the
principles in new problem situations. These experimental students
were compared with a control group
that was only taught the principles
(but not their application). On the
higher mental processes, the experimental group was 2 sigma
above the control students (the
average experimental student was
above 98% of the control students)
in the ability to apply the principles
to new problem situations.
A third study by Mevarech (1980)
was directed at improving the
higher mental processes by emphasizing heuristic problem solving
and including higher and lower
mental process questions in the formative testing and in the feedbackcorrective processes. On the higher
mental process part of the summative tests, the group using the
heuristic methods + ML (HMP
Teaching + ML) was 1.3 sigma
above the control group (L.M.P.
Teaching) taught primarily by
learning algorithms-a set of rules
and procedures for solving particular math problems (the average
student in this experimental group
was above 90% of the control students).
In all of these studies, attempts to
improve higher mental processes included group instruction emphasizing higher mental processes and
feedback-corrective processes,
which also emphasized higher mental processes. In addition, the tutoring studies included an instructional
emphasis on both higher and lower
mental processes, as well as the
feedback-corrective processes,
which included both higher and
lower mental processes. It was evident in all of these studies that in
the formative feedback and corrective processes the students needed
and received more corrective help
on the higher mental processes
questions and problems than they
did on the lower mental process
questions.

Summary
The Anania (1982, 1983) and
Burke (1984) studies comparing student learning under one-to-one
tutoring, ML, and conventional
group instruction began in 1980. As
the results of these separate studies
at different grade levels and in different school subjects began to
emerge, we were astonished at the
consistency of the findings as well
as the great differences in student
cognitive achievement, attitudes,
and academic self-concept under
tutoring as compared with the
group methods of instruction.
During the past 4 years, the graduate students in my seminars at the
University of Chicago and Northwestern University considered various approaches to the search for
group methods of instruction that
might be as effective as one-to-one
tutoring. This paper reports on the
research studies these students
have completed, the studies that are
still in process, and some of the
other ideas we explored in these
seminars.
Although all of us at first thought
it was an impossible task, we did
agree that if we succeeded in finding one solution, there would soon
be a great many solutions. In this
paper, I report on six solutions to
the 2 sigma problem. In spite of the
difficulties, our graduate students
found the problem to be very intriguing because the goal was so
clear and specific-find methods of
group instruction as effective as oneto-one tutoring.
Early in the work, it became evident that more than group instruction in the school had to be considered. We also needed to find ways
of improving the students' learning
processes, the curriculum and instructional materials, as well as the
home environmental support of the
students' school learning. This
paper is only a preliminary report
on what has been accomplished to
date, but it should be evident that
much can now be done to improve
student learning in the schools.
However, the search is far from
complete. We look for additional
solutions to the 2 sigma problem to
be reported in the next few years.
I hope some of the readers of this
article will also find this problem
challenging.
