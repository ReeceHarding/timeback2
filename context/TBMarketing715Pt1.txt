[Speaker 1]
So I was just telling them while you were on the couch over there, I think the agenda and subject to change, of course, is first. You sent me an email with everyone's everyone on the intern teams what they're individually working on.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Right. Is that that was the directive that you sent out yesterday. Right.

Oh, cool. So what I was thinking is just understand, like, have everyone talk about a little bit about what they're working on. Any blockers that they have.

Right. If it's me, how can I uncover that? If it's you or Reese, at least it's documented.

And then once I have kind of like a 30,000 view of what the interns individually are working on, then we can go back and focus on the actual time back marketing implementation website. Right. The only thing that I'm wondering about now is that there's well, obviously, there's there's five interns total that I've seen.

So there's three, three people that are not here. So how best to go about collecting, just figuring out what they're what they're working on. Right.

[Speaker 3]
Are we saying there are nine.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, really, Reese is here.

[Speaker 3]
Wow.

[Speaker 1]
Because I got a text from him this morning at four o'clock. Well, I got a text from her. So if you'll be here, great.

[Speaker 2]
OK, so Zach said he'll be here in 15 minutes.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. And he will not be able to join us, but she will be available to you in about a week. OK, that's fine.

And is she working on something, though, that is OK being delayed a week, though? Video. What kind?

Just amplification, distribution, editing. So is it video for like marketing time back? Yeah.

OK, then that could be. It could be. OK.

OK, well, then that's OK. Anything video heavy. I think there's more pressing priorities.

So we don't have to go into that. And then what about the last? There's a fifth person.

Right.

[Speaker 2]
There's Zach and then there's Reneal, who is SEM. OK. He's joining.

[Speaker 1]
He's joining.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
OK. I just want to ask him what is what is that? What does that exactly entail?

Right. And then what if any blockers exist? And does he have like a deliverable or some sort of like metric or deadline?

Right. Deliverable or deadline. Just so I understand what's going on here.

I don't really hear that.

[Speaker 4]
OK.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, we can hear you. I don't think it is.

[Speaker 1]
Did you hear us? OK. Reneal.

Cool. My name is Tim. I'm just trying to get an understanding of what's going on.

Yes. I was told that you were assigned to SEM. I would appreciate it if you could just explain to me quickly what that exactly does that entail.

If you have any blockers. And then finally, is there a deliverable and deadline associated with your task involving search engine marketing? OK.

[Speaker 4]
At least the strategy that I've been thinking with is to combine it with a portfolio theory.

[Speaker 3]
And so what that means is I'm treating the SEM champions as portfolio assets and essentially optimizing that mix. And there's been some financial theory involved in that sort of what I've been optimizing for in the past.

[Speaker 2]
And that's sort of what my project is working towards at the moment.

[Speaker 1]
OK.

[Speaker 4]
What was the second question?

[Speaker 1]
Do you have any blockers?

[Speaker 4]
Blockers in what sense?

[Speaker 1]
Like, are you waiting on someone else to get something done for you? Are you waiting for assets? Is there anything preventing you from moving forward with your work?

[Speaker 2]
Are there currently any blockers per se? I mean, of course, the whole idea was to have the super builders build the product. At least that was my understanding of it.

So I guess if you want to consider that a blocker, then that's something.

[Speaker 1]
But other than that, not really anything per se. And then the last thing was about any deadlines. Yes.

And what day is that? What day is that? OK.

So we have, give or take, about a month. Hey, Renil, are you available after that?

[Speaker 2]
I'll have to check my schedule depending on how school ends up, but I will try to make it so.

[Speaker 1]
So you'll hear back from me by the end of day today. I just got to talk to the guy. You haven't met him yet, but cool.

I think that's it for you. Yeah, great job. Just send over the stuff and we'll try to get you rolling as fast as possible.

Who's next? There's another there's an unfamiliar face. I'm sorry.

Alexandra. Nice to meet you. Sorry.

Don't worry about it. It's all good. If you can just tell me what you're working on.

Deliverables and blockers. Sorry, this might seem a little pedantic, but I just, I haven't met everyone on the intern team. So I'm just trying to, this is it for me.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, makes sense. Yeah, so the process, so I'm focused specifically on SEO.

[Speaker 2]
So I came up with a blog that completely automates the SEO process and also optimizes for search engines, which is really important with the increased usage of AI rather than the search engine pages.

[Speaker 3]
But right now I'm pivoting to what Joe wants right now, which is the page for time back.

[Speaker 2]
So right now I'm kind of coming up with a social media strategy for time back and making sure that everything is still optimized for SEO.

[Speaker 1]
I kind of came up with my own deliverable. Cool. That's okay.

[Speaker 2]
So I'm working on a presentation for the social media strategy and I think I'll be done with it today, quite honestly, probably by end of day.

[Speaker 1]
Very cool.

[Speaker 2]
But I don't have a deadline for that.

[Speaker 5]
That was kind of self-directed.

[Speaker 4]
I wanted to convey the social media strategy and I thought that the presentation would be the best way to do that.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, perfect. So just to make sure that I understand, before you pivoted over to the social media strategy for time back, you were working on SEO and SEO for AI, whatever that term is, because I know there's a lot of different ones. So do you have a brain lift for all that stuff that you had researched or anything like that?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I want to get in the practice of information sharing.

[Speaker 1]
I don't want too many institutional silos where people are like, well, I don't know where to find this. I think it's this person. Oh, it's not this person.

It's that person. But very good. Well, cool.

I'm excited to see what you have because personally, on a personal level, I think what you're working on on the SEO AI stuff is really interesting and super beneficial, of course, to the time back website that we're redoing, especially if it's going to go into this dynamically generated content stuff. I'm not sure if you're familiar with what that means, but we'll fill you in. So no blockers.

That's what I'm understanding. There's nothing blocking you?

[Speaker 2]
No blockers. But then for time back right now, I don't think any blockers. It's just looking what else.

I saw the time back notes and looked into SEO and the regenerating content. I have some notes on that.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, cool.

[Speaker 2]
Have you gotten all the PRDs?

[Speaker 1]
No. Oh, yeah. Wait.

All I've gotten was like, I think I did get PRDs for sure. You should have a PRD for everybody. I can't remember if it was a pitch or a number of PRDs, but it was something like that.

[Speaker 2]
Alexander, and correct me if I'm wrong, so you're really SEO content in campaigns, right?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. So it's a little bit more than just SEO. Cool.

And then just to make sure, and that's completely different than what, is it a- Renio. Renio is working on for the SEM. Okay.

Cool. Just wanted to make sure. And one of Alexander's early insights was really about how to format the content for AEO, GEO, LLM optimization.

Amazing. I'd love to see that work. Just out of curiosity.

I think it's super cool. Okay. Awesome.

Thank you. Looking forward to the presentation either today or tomorrow or whatever.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah. I'll send everything over.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. And then, is there anyone next on remote or? No, I just think that's everybody.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
AI readers. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, Zach.

[Speaker 1]
I see a Zach. Yeah. Cool.

Hey, Zach.

[Speaker 4]
Hey Tim. Sorry, I'll be there in a couple minutes.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, no. You're on your way. Oh, yeah.

Okay. Cool. Cool.

[Speaker 2]
But I was working on social listening and automating that side. Okay. So it really starts at the beginning of the marketing campaign when you launch and you're looking for content and locations to place that content online.

Okay. So you can maximize it and reach. And so the gist of it is we'll be testing for content on X because that's typically the place where the content begins and inspires content on TikTok.

Instagram and LinkedIn. And so coming from that, and then as soon as you detect trends that are blowing up, we'll use information that we get from the other sites, including Google Trends, to triangulate that and see if it's a credible trend. Cool.

And ultimately, deliver it to users in a signal base versus dashboard. Like a lot of times, a lot of times these softwares will present all this data, you need one big panel. That's great for marketing professionals, but for individuals who are just starting businesses and don't have all that expertise, it can be really overwhelming.

And so it'll just be kind of an approved-denied signal. Like, is this a good fit for my business? Is this not?

And then over time, we'll use reinforcement learning to be able to mimic their decision-making process and turn it into a hands-on thing where you can initiate additional listening campaigns, scrape all the data that comes from there, send it to the relevant tools like and then use final performance, like you did this convert into a sales disconverter,

[Speaker 4]
instead of people coming to an event, and use that to do the conversion.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. Is there any blockers other than you just need a developer to build this out?

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. Cool. Okay.

So that seems to be a common trend. All right. So, awesome.

I think that's pretty much it. We can just talk about the rest of the stuff going on. I didn't realize that it's just basically the PRDs that I received earlier.

So now that I know, it's all good. Cool. Is there any deliverables or deadlines associated with USAC that you can think of other than the end of the year internship?

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 4]
Cool.

[Speaker 2]
Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. I think, yeah, I think that's it. That was super helpful.

Thank you for the introduction, everyone. And I'm going to try my best to help you with the main blocker, which is finding engineers to get you what you guys need. So, we'll see.

Just give me a couple of days. I'll have, I think that over the next couple of days, I think I'll be able to pick off one by one and get you guys an engineer to start working on your ideas. But, cool.

I think that's pretty much it.

[Speaker 5]
Thank you. That's very helpful.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Yeah. No, I don't have anything.

That's great. Yep. And I think, I mean, in total, I think they need six engineers.

But the news is, we'll be ready to go until next week. Okay. Yeah, that's fine.

That's perfect. Perfect. That gives me time to actually find people.

Hey, how you doing? Pleased to meet you, actually, in person. Good to see you.

Thanks for coming on in. Okay. Okay, so with that being said, I think we can kind of change gears about the, change gears of time back marketing.

Have you guys all seen the notes from Joe, the most recent notes from his discussion with Reese last Sunday? Probably not. Probably not.

Okay. Is there a way that we can pull that up there somehow or screencast it?

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
It's pretty brief. But basically, my understanding from Reese and my phone calls with Reese was, I don't know, wait. If you guys, if one of you guys can screencast it up, that would be helpful.

It happens.

[Speaker 4]
So close.

[Speaker 2]
Do we have something? I'm not. I think I found it.

[Speaker 1]
Yes, this way. So, yeah, my understanding was that Joe, Reese told me that Joe saw the, whatever, the landing page that Reese built and was like, okay, that's cool. We can close it out, but let's accelerate towards like the final implementation of the time back website.

Command plus, plus, plus. It'll make it bigger.

[Speaker 2]
Ah, there we go.

[Speaker 1]
For us older people with bad eyes. Cool.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay. So Joe, what Joe wants is. Hyper tailored real time generated content.

So basically. No, because remember, we have multiple demographics of users for time back. Correct.

We have parents. We have kids. We have sovereign nations.

We have governments and we have educators and whether that's administrators or teachers, each one of these demographics is very different from one another. Each one of these demographics, of course, there may be some overlap, but each one of these demos are going to want different content or there's going to be different content that they're going to be interested in. Right.

And so the idea here is that there is some sort of questionnaire that puts the website visitor in a particular bucket. Once they're silent in that particular bucket, the LM or the website will dynamically render a tailored website to that specific demographic. And if they're another demographic, that person will not see whatever a parent saw.

So if you're a teacher, you're going on the website, you're not going to see what a parent sees. So this is difficult. I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before, but I do think that's hyper.

My personal opinion is that hyper-customized, dynamically rendered real-time content is or dynamically rendered UI UX is kind of the next wave. Like because it's so cheap and so cost effective and fast to build UI UXs and websites that I think we're going to gravitate towards a hyper-personalized world. Right.

Like each website visitor has their own UI UX that is rendered according to their preferences. So I think the number one important thing here is that one, we have to save their preference. Right.

Which is why your earlier question of what comes first, is it email or demographic, if you will. That's a good question. I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
Well, at least from previous conversations, capturing the email would be initially.

[Speaker 1]
It would be really hard initially.

[Speaker 3]
Important.

[Speaker 1]
Important initially. Any other thoughts?

[Speaker 2]
Joe just said outright that his main idea for the landing page site that we have out right now is that he wants to be able to capture emails.

[Speaker 1]
That's his main priority is to capture emails.

[Speaker 2]
For right now. For right now. I think as and when we build out a more full site, obviously there needs to be more, but for right now, he wants to know if people are interested.

[Speaker 1]
Well, isn't that what Reese, didn't Reese build that out?

[Speaker 2]
That's what I'm saying. We have that now.

[Speaker 1]
We have that now. Yeah. So now we focus on what that experience looks like on the actual real website.

Right.

[Speaker 2]
And just to confirm, what kind of parents, children, school, students. That's a lot. And what's the stop having five template versions of the website?

You know, people pick from the five ICPs. Like which one they're for. I don't like that.

I'm like having certain elements that slightly adjust based on IP.

[Speaker 1]
I think that's ultimately what we have to do. Like you can't, it has to be templates anyways. Right.

Like otherwise, if there's no tracks to put these demographics on, then like it's just too, there's too much variance that can come on. Right. Because these LLMs hallucinate.

Right. They're not as dependable as one would assume. So we're going to have to create like sandboxes.

So essentially there is going to be five templates. Maybe one day we'll get to that point, but we're not, I don't think we're there yet. So I think fundamentally, I don't think this website is too difficult to build out, but there are some like UI UX questions that are, that we're going to have to figure out now.

And those are the ones that are more difficult to understand. Right. The alternative here is that like, we should of course be doing things like A and B testing.

So maybe, maybe there are five tracks of a website, but there's actually 10. So like five in one A version testing and then five for B version testing. And then also in the A version, we're going to be experimenting with collecting the email up front.

Yeah. And then in the B version, collecting the email at the end of their journey. Right.

And see which one converts more. We don't know. Right.

After they've gone through the website for their particular track. Right. Or ICP.

That's a good point as well. I don't know.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I don't know if the whole website or not. That is some information.

[Speaker 2]
One of the captions you just said last week was initially we were going to do an email plus like a form that you would fill out. Yeah. Like I want to be able to get their email even if they decide not to fill out the form.

So like email should be the first thing that goes in.

[Speaker 1]
And if that's the case. Hey, Reese.

[Speaker 2]
What up?

[Speaker 1]
Nice haircut. Thanks, dude. Cool.

[Speaker 2]
We can definitely experiment with that. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
That's actually a good point. You're right about that.

[Speaker 2]
Hello.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. Okay. Reese, we had just started regarding this.

So I'm sure that there might have been some context that was missed out. Yeah. That wasn't captured in all these notes.

So if you want to go ahead. Sure. So.

[Speaker 2]
I'm sure how it went. I guess going way back for you, Zach. So Wednesday, Joe came in.

He's like, hey, I want a site for the podcast next week. Me and Dylan and... We built out a site.

Joe was not happy with said site. These two lovely humans. Built out a site that Joe and Mackenzie were happy with.

And then we... So basically Joe to you two basically said like Montessori Mom vibes. Like storytelling.

Sort of walk them through why Timeback's legit. And then I had lunch with Joe on Sunday. Not just me, but a group.

And basically he said like he wants Timeback. He's like two things. One, I want Timeback to like...

He's like Incept generates content for kids that's tailored. Which it doesn't, but in theory it does. Why can't our website generate content for parents that's tailored to them?

And I think the idea behind that is he wants it to like... You get to this site and it's like boom. Like the impression you get is like technical.

Like this is amazing. This is legit. All of those good things.

That being said... I don't know if it's the best user experience. I think like basically Joe just like...

He just wants a dope site. And like each time we talk to him he like throws out his ideas. And I've been like overfitting to what he says.

Where I'm like technical. Alright, very technical. And then he says emotional.

I'm like very emotional. I think in reality we should like try and think just like... What does someone want to learn when they come to our site?

And then we build that. I think Joe would be open to our advice. I think he wants it to be a little ungenerated in like real time.

Based on like users location and the questions they fill out. Could be doable. I don't think it's ever been done before.

Which... Kind of scares me. Like usually if it doesn't exist there's a reason it doesn't exist.

But... Maybe we'll be the first. Yes I agree.

We have a safe site. It sounds like a large language model. It's basically...

We're hosting a foundational model that has access to proprietary data. Maybe it's videos. Maybe it's content that you might not find elsewhere on the internet.

Correct. Because it's probably the place that you have something to find out about. Which like that in itself doesn't seem too difficult.

You're kind of just... You're building a wrapper online. Mm-hmm.

But... And like once we get into testing then we'll release our Q. Like oh there's a bunch of users.

Totally. Yeah. I mean in theory it should be possible.

Like I think you can get like a low latency model with like Brock. With the Q. Which is like a really fast inference provider.

In theory it should be like less than like half a second. Before we can start getting responses. But...

Like I said it doesn't exist. Yeah. It's like why doesn't it exist?

I feel like there's this... So we have all this existing content today. Mm-hmm.

And I feel like... It's simply a matter of tagging it right. Yeah we can like...

[Speaker 4]
And mapping it.

[Speaker 2]
Mm-hmm. You can like... Yeah, yeah.

Pretty much. There's something called like RAG. Which is like you like label each piece of data.

And then based on what the like user wants. It'll pull that specific data in. And then the LLM can use that for its response.

I mean so should we...

[Speaker 1]
Should our... Someone on our group. Should we be focused on doing that?

[Speaker 2]
On tagging what's already exists? Or... No the AI can like do that automatically.

Yeah. I think... In my view it's like...

I think the first step should be... We each like build out a site that we think looks good. And then we show Joe like...

Five to like ten different sites. And then see which one like... Kind of excites him.

And then once we have that structure. I think we can just integrate in the AI stuff. To like fill in the different fields.

[Speaker 5]
To dynamically render it. According to what track they're on.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah dynamically like render the copy. I think we have a standardized like... Website.

I thought we were supposed to do a little process on the site. What was that? We've just gotten the...

The email capture. That's the only thing he's approved so far. Yeah.

Okay. I'm caught up. Yeah so you approve the landing page.

We still have to build out like... The site. The site.

So yeah in my view... We each like maybe build out a site. I think like Dylan you built a pretty good one.

I don't know if you guys did that together.

[Speaker 1]
Oh you used lovable?

[Speaker 2]
I did yeah. Sick. I think Anjali you had a pretty good vision for the layout of the site.

So maybe do you want to go over?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. I'm not sure if that's what he wants.

[Speaker 1]
Show us. No I'm kidding.

[Speaker 3]
Okay well I think... We saw a lot of fun vision we had on Friday. Like to talk about exactly how we want to do it.

So it would start off with the landing page that we currently have. So Dylan do you want to go next?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah I'm curious. Because I saw the one reset. Oh this is cool.

[Speaker 3]
So this is what he's going to be using this week. I guess to get emails from people.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. Hey good job.

[Speaker 3]
And so ideally this would also be the starting page of the site. So on top in the header we would have like proof. Where he wants to talk about results that AlphaKids have had in time.

What they've had in general. And he said that there's no point in differentiating between Alpha and Timeback right now. Because Timeback is a product of Alpha.

So it's one and the same. And he kind of wants it to tell a story. Which is where the emotional side comes in from.

He wants us to be able to make the parents of whoever's visiting the site feel like they're in their position. So it's like imagine your 7th grader doesn't know how to read. Something like that.

And then you have a stat of the reading abilities of 7th graders. This and that. And then we share what Alpha's been able to do.

And then he wants to move into learning science. We agreed that to have learning science in a separate page would be ideal. Just because it's heavy content.

Not a lot of people are willing to actually read through those papers and things like that. Agreed. So maybe having just like highlighted stats from each case.

But also linking it to the papers and official articles. Whatever it is. And then finally it's the differentiating factors about why Time Back is different than every other.

Well there's no other education.

[Speaker 1]
There's no other.

[Speaker 2]
It's more different than other AIs. He really wants it to be.

[Speaker 1]
Wow. Like AI educational ed tech.

[Speaker 2]
He wants it to be very clear that we're not just a chatbot. We're not just giving your kid ChatGBT and letting it run.

[Speaker 1]
Yes.

[Speaker 2]
We have specific ways we use AI to generate personalized lesson plans. And they use AI to track your attention span and whatever. And coach you that way.

But be very clear on what AI does and what it doesn't do.

[Speaker 3]
He had a list of things that Time Back does. And he's like, Time Back only does this, this, this, this, this. And he compares it to all the other existing.

[Speaker 1]
Like a comparison chart? Or was it just text?

[Speaker 3]
It was just text that he wrote out. Ideally, I think he wants the whole website from each page to tell the story and to follow that format. Because right now, you look at the tutorial learning website, and it's extremely random.

They just share results that don't really mean anything to anyone. He also wants there to be some degree of interactivity on the website so people can compare their child's school's math results to alpha. And it's like those results aren't publicly put out because most public schools don't do that.

So it's like he just wants people to kind of question why their school doesn't do that.

[Speaker 1]
Makes sense.

[Speaker 3]
Like have people think about, you know, my school is probably not doing that great. And then look at a general comparison of alpha's results.

[Speaker 2]
Cool.

[Speaker 3]
Just to spark that curiosity.

[Speaker 2]
One of the things he said was, like, potential, like, give them a list of prompts that they could ask. Chat you into your cloud or something like that. Hey, like, can you pull my school's math results or whatever and compare them to this?

And he was like, it's about, like, sowing a seed of doubt in their school that it's not, like, available data. And he wants all of our data to be, like, very transparent. Like, look, we're showing you everything.

Why is it that your school isn't showing you?

[Speaker 1]
Good thought. That might be a little bit difficult. Well, never mind.

I love it. Okay. So you did a great job, by the way.

Whoever made this landing page, well, both of you guys, you did a great job. In its simplicity.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Right? Sorry, Reese. You tried good, too.

Cool. I'm excited for this, though. Because I think we have a little bit more clarity.

When we first met the other week, we were talking about, is it technical or emotional? So now we know that it's emotional. It's a lot easier to do.

Not a lot easier to do, but that's a lot more clear to me. Initial thoughts when I think about emotional is the marketing should revolve around outcomes. Like, you're essentially painting a picture, right?

[Speaker 2]
Tim, have you seen that PowerPoint, the branding PowerPoint?

[Speaker 1]
Can't say I can recall. Did you see it? Yeah.

If someone could send it to me, that would be great. Appreciate it.

[Speaker 2]
After we did all this stuff, Joe was like, oh, here.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, really?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Oh, wow. I had this outside firm do this.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 3]
They have the colors.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, they have the whole color palette and everything? Yeah. Wow, okay.

I did not see this. That would be very helpful.

[Speaker 2]
We didn't see it when we moved over there.

[Speaker 1]
When did you guys get it? Over the weekend?

[Speaker 2]
We got it once we signed him wet.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah, that would be helpful.

To me, that's typical Joe.

[Speaker 2]
He's like, bro. You showed me this before we built this site.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
You can do, and then, oh, I've already invested $50,000 in a firm.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. Some of the Monka ads, like, they're pretty good. Yeah.

I mean, they have clearly put a lot of time and effort into that thing. At first, I thought it was like 18 pages. It's like 50 or 60 pages.

[Speaker 1]
Cool. Yeah, please email. So, what do you think, Reese?

[Speaker 2]
So, I think.

[Speaker 1]
What to do here.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. I think we should think through, like, when the user comes to the site, what do they want to learn, and how can we best provide that to them? Kind of like get a plan through that, and maybe each of us build a proposal.

Like, how we would design the site. Send those to Joe and Mackenzie. I think Mackenzie's actually, like, the decision maker.

Seems like everything we're sending to Joe, he's like, all right, I'll show Mackenzie. So, if we can access her as well. I don't know.

Is she in town? I have no idea. She's on the road, right?

[Speaker 1]
She's on road shows for alpha extension.

[Speaker 2]
Like, basically, just get a site that both of them like, and then from there, we can implement the fancy, like, you know, AI. Yeah, 26,000 people signed up for alpha anywhere.

[Speaker 1]
26,000 people. Yeah. That's tremendous.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Congrats to them.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah. That makes sense to me, though.

[Speaker 2]
Is that through Mackenzie?

[Speaker 1]
No, it's Joe Marone's running that one.

[Speaker 2]
Do you know how they got that distribution? I have no idea.

[Speaker 1]
I just, he posted something in Slack the other day. Cool. I had heard from, you probably want to ask AJ if you're curious about that, because AJ works with them.

And AJ was telling me that Joe was doing a great job, actually, of getting a lot of interest in that. So, that obviously manifested with 26,000 sign-ups. Cool.

[Speaker 3]
So, when you build up the site, what do you want to do with that? And how far do you want it to go?

[Speaker 1]
Well, remember that we had originally discussed that, like, the design is probably the most important, because actually, for the actual content, that can be slipped in dynamically, according to what track that is. So, realistically, what you want- As much as matters where the images go. Yeah.

So, it's, like, put it with dummy content, try to create, like, a really nice visual experience that remains consistent with the brand packaging that we got. But if you also feel like the brand- Does Joe love that brand packaging?

[Speaker 2]
Mackenzie picked this specifically.

[Speaker 1]
Oh, okay. Then, okay. Then we roll with that, right?

[Speaker 2]
And also, we have, I mean, these two, spend many hours collecting all of the, like, learning science, all of the white papers and everything. Yeah. Like, honestly, like, the content's not- Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
It'd be as easy as, like- Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Cool. Like, the content shouldn't be just, like, here's all the content, throw it in somewhere. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Well, okay. Here's- There's the content, right? Mm-hmm.

Which I would imagine is, like, learning science, right? And then there- Then what we haven't determined is, like, the emotional storytelling, right? So maybe there is a little bit more, when you're building out your mock-ups of this, whatever site you're building out, like, you may have to not- I don't think you can use placeholder content for everything, right?

Because some- Yeah. Because some of the storytelling, right? It leans- It's paired pretty closely with how the design works out, right?

Or how the elements are organized and how visually things are rendered, so.

[Speaker 4]
Totally.

[Speaker 1]
But I would just urge you to think about- Because I try to do this, I have to remind myself also about this, is that, like, when you're selling stories or telling stories, outcomes are really important, right? Like, it's not all benefits. I always- I think, like, when you look online for a lot of, like, digital- Or, like, a lot of websites for SaaS companies or tech companies in general, they're always yapping about the benefits.

And it's like, dude, no one cares. Tell me how you're going to save me money or make me more money. You know what I mean?

Like, things like that. So, try to think about it like that. These are parents that we're talking about, right?

Joe has already explicitly said it's Montessori moms. So, Montessori moms are- They're moms, so. They're interested about stories.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, not super technical.

[Speaker 1]
Not super technical, right? That's more for, yeah, someone else.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah. That's why he didn't like the site we built. He said it felt too- Technical?

He was like, this feels too much like we're selling technology. And he was like, I feel like the average mother is going to look at this and think that I'm sending the AI Terminator at their kid, and then I'm not going to sign it.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, exactly. Well, at the end of the day, I'm just happy that we've arrived at the emotional stuff because that is how it needs to be presented. Totally.

[Speaker 2]
Okay. Okay.

[Speaker 1]
Okay, I have not seen this before.

[Speaker 2]
Yes, Joe said slides 20, 22, and 23.

[Speaker 1]
Are relevant to us? Mm-hmm. Okay.

Well, I think it's important. I'll have to read all of this stuff, to be honest.

[Speaker 2]
It's all important, but- We put together three different landing pages using color combinations from that, and this is the one we can do. This is similar. So I think- Yeah, it's a little weird.

Are you talking about the Joker-looking picture? Yeah. So what?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, the Joker picture is a little funny, but some of these posters are actually- Learning Just Got Schooled is really cool. Yeah. Okay, 20.

You said 20 to 22. 20, 22, 23. 20, 22, 23.

Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, I kind of like the imagery with the kids' faces. You like it? I like it.

It's so cool. Interesting. It stuck with me, man.

It stuck with me, man. I just said, I don't know that it stuck with me, and it made me think, like, school. It's like, the eyes are almost X's, and that means they're dead.

That's part of the terminator. That would be cool.

[Speaker 1]
I guess I don't really understand what this is. The circles and the- See? Oh, well.

I'm not getting paid for it.

[Speaker 2]
Well, and they're not consistent with it, right?

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that's a little strange to me, right? Like, here there is with two circles here. I don't think they knew what it was.

And division sign, right? And then we go back to two circles and division sign. All right, well, it's beyond our payroll, so let's not worry about it.

But this is really good, actually. I think some of this is really cool. Like, it's all directional, right?

Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 2]
Let's do a whiteboarding session. But, like, stories. Like, what the site kind of should look like.

Cool.

[Speaker 1]
You're not racist. Well, did someone take a picture of all this stuff? I have.

You have? I have. Okay, cool.

Send it to the cleaners.

[Speaker 2]
So Montessori Moms is obviously a subset of the five ICBs that we're looking at. Right. Do we want to start there first?

Because, I mean, the story line is going to be very different for each one, I think. Yeah, that's a good question. I think so.

Because I'm assuming, like, the reason for that is the podcast is going on is probably predominantly Montessori Moms.

[Speaker 1]
And we do have bio-personas on who we think our parents are.

[Speaker 2]
Oh, we do? Already? Where is that information?

It's in my brainwork. I'll send it to you.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, that would be great. I love it. There's already personas being built out already?

This looks a little weird, to be honest, to me.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, right?

[Speaker 1]
This looks strange, but. Well, especially because the language is, like, the revolutionized. The revolution.

Yeah, that's scary.

[Speaker 4]
That's a little scary. Are we able to maybe see a link here? Yeah.

[Speaker 1]
Yeah, we'll get you to that.

[Speaker 2]
A monitor or a touch screen? Whatever is fine. Okay, so start with Montessori Moms or parents.

[Speaker 1]
Aren't they the same?

[Speaker 2]
I think the same, no?

[Speaker 1]
Why wouldn't they be the same?

[Speaker 2]
Well, not every parent is a Montessori Mom.

[Speaker 1]
Perfect.

[Speaker 2]
But I think, well, so the way I envision it is, like, sort of custom tailored to, like, five ICPs. So I think, like, there won't be a Montessori Mom ICP. There will be a parent ICP.

So probably parent, but, like.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Will we know? I don't know. Joe also said he wants, like, max one question.

When the user first comes to the site. Does that include email?

[Speaker 1]
It can't be.

[Speaker 2]
No. So, like, you come to the site, and it's like, which of these five are you? And then we, like, custom it.

But does it still want email to be one of the first? Well, so I think it's, like, questionnaire. And then we, like, show you our main page, essentially.

And, like, so that's part of the generated site. Yeah. Yeah.

You put your email in. Something pops up. Go to questions here.

Click on that. Yeah. But I don't think the email does help here.

It's more so just, like, he wants. Yeah. That's easier to write.

It's very easy to write. Like, since the email is the most important part of the semester, could it be something like this where we just had, like, five different buttons? So it's, like, enter your email, and then we'll put some other quality in.

And then so it's, like, we get the email, but we also get your thing. And basically it's one more step.

[Speaker 1]
Does that make any sense? It does to me, but I'm thinking about, like, whether we're kind of overloading them. Yeah, visually.

Right. Because that's an important consideration.

[Speaker 3]
Can it not be, like, a follow-up question?

[Speaker 1]
What is a follow-up question? In this example, is it email as a follow-up, or what category?

[Speaker 3]
Category.

[Speaker 1]
So it's still email first?

[Speaker 2]
Yes.

[Speaker 3]
Why would you do email second?

[Speaker 1]
That makes sense.

[Speaker 2]
Some people do email second because it's, like, buy-in. Like, once you click something, then you're already. But they shouldn't.

Basically, it's a buy-in, yeah. Yeah, a lot of play around. Because this is more just, like, having people check out.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah. They should be seeing this as, like, this is me visiting a website for the first time. This is how I get started.

If not, this is my buy-in. The buy-in should be later. The buy-in is going to be quickly.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah.

[Speaker 3]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I feel like this is probably one of the biggest parts of the AP test, is that the email is our result. And we're going to have, like, the most users come to the top of that. So, like, if we're just thinking about the stories, we can design the stories first.

And then, like, play this around it. Yeah. Focus on that.

[Speaker 1]
What are you trying to talk about right here? What stories are we going to use? My experience talking to parents.

One is always excited about that AP test. One is always excited about the well-learned techniques, the life skills, or the entrepreneurship.

[Speaker 2]
The thing is, like, we can't really talk about life skills or entrepreneurship. Because you made it very clear that, like, time back is not school. It's just academics.

Yeah. We're not selling AlphaSchool. We're just selling the academics at AlphaSchool.

So he's not trying to, like, enforce.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, the idea is that we'll give them time back.

[Speaker 2]
We'll give them time back to do whatever they want with that. But, like, we're only focusing on, like, the academics. It's not the academics.

Right? What AlphaSchool does with their time back is not what you're saying.
