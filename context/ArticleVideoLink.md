Brownsville Stats - https://2hourlearning.com/category/featured/?utm_source=perplexity 

“When we opened our campus in Brownsville, Texas, children entering the second grade class averaged in the 31st percentile. In just one year, they climbed into the 84th percentile. The 2 Hour Learning model takes its name from the fact that in two hours, students learn twice as much, twice as fast. “

https://2hourlearning.com/the-six-hour-school-day-is-dead-luckily-theres-an-even-better-solution/?utm_source=perplexity

“Students learn twice as much, twice as fast — literally. In traditional schools, a fifth grader who gains four points in math gains eight here. For a seventh grader in the 99th percentile at a traditional school, that jump is from seven points to 14.

To be especially blunt, the halls of Alpha are not filled with nepo-baby prodigies. One of our campuses (Alpha Brownsville) lies in the heart of one of the poorest districts in America, and many of our students there come from significantly disadvantaged backgrounds. Even still, they learn at more than twice the rate of their peers in traditional schools. Socioeconomic status does not sway the success of the model.”
