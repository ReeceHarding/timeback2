üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES
=================================================================

## DELIVERABLES & COMMITMENTS

### YNG/TIM‚Äôs Commitments
- Build the database / backend structure for Timeback, manipulate Excel sheets, and up-sert them into the DB ‚Äì ‚Äútonight + tomorrow‚Äù (within 24 hrs)
- Set up a group chat with Paul to ask technical questions
- Synthesise a written report of this call and draft a list of questions for Joe (after call)
- Drive to the office if Joe appears and demo current front-end planning, while noting backend is still in progress

### Reece‚Äôs Commitments
- Work the rest of tonight on front-end ‚Äúmodules‚Äù ‚Äì design useful interactive UI components for parents using the raw Excel data (no DB required yet)
- Review Tim‚Äôs videos / updates and give feedback

### Mutual / Shared Commitments
- Aim to ship a parent-focused MVP by ‚Äúend of the month‚Äù to claim the bounty
- Ensure the product is ‚Äúproduction ready‚Äù by 14 August when Joe‚Äôs email blast to thousands of parents goes out

---

## BLOCKERS & OBSTACLES
- **No chatbot allowed** (Joe‚Äôs ‚Äúred line‚Äù): forces bespoke module UI and complicates data collection
- **Data availability** for other ICPs (educators, philanthropists, etc.) is unclear; only parent dataset is in hand
- **Arthur is unresponsive** to data requests; causes delays
- **Complexity** of new tech, unfamiliar data structures, and quality-control burden for AI-rendered graphics
- **Uncertainty** about Joe‚Äôs exact expectations for Aug 1 vs Aug 14 deliverables (Tim seeking clarification)

## KEY NUMBERS & METRICS
- **7 Aug 2024** ‚Äì internal guides meeting (low-stakes milestone)
- **14 Aug 2024** ‚Äì ‚Äúhard stop‚Äù / production-ready public launch (email to thousands of parents)
- **Salary dispute:** Adam asked to ‚Äúdouble‚Äù his salary prior to dismissal (exact figures not given)
- **10 personalised insight examples** already extracted from the parent dataset

=================================================================

=================================================================
COMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS ANALYSIS
=================================================================

#### TOPIC: Parent-Focused MVP (Initial ICP)
- **Core Points:** Need interactive ‚Äúmodules‚Äù (e.g., find a school near you, compare school scores, kid‚Äôs interests) that both deliver value and collect data. Pre-built modules preferred for QC; AI chooses among them
- **Quantitative Details:** 10 personalised insight examples already extracted; deadlines 31 Jul (MVP) & 14 Aug (launch)
- **Process & Ops:** Backend stores datasets; front-end renders with bar/pie/table modules; user preferences stored for future sessions
- **Viability Factors:** Must avoid chatbot UI yet feel conversational; speed of rendering important (loader considered)

#### TOPIC: Data Infrastructure
- **Points:** Need DB schema, data manipulation of raw Excel sheets, up-sert pipeline
- **Ops Details:** Tim handling schema build tonight/tomorrow
- **Challenges:** New tech unfamiliarity, ensuring data fits each module type

#### TOPIC: Multi-ICP Expansion
- **Points:** After parent MVP, replicate for other ICPs; need datasets & UI ideas
- **Risk:** Currently no data for other ICPs; must consult Joe for contacts

#### TOPIC: Team Dynamics & HR Issues
- **Points:** Adam fired after raising salary request; Arthur‚Äôs management style seen as blocker; Austin offers placement help if Adam asks
- **Impact:** Morale, resource availability, potential reputational considerations

=================================================================
STRATEGIC BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE
=================================================================

##### Business Opportunities
- Highly personalised, data-rich school site differentiating from generic chatbots
- Leveraging user-selected visualisations to improve engagement and collect preference data
- Potential to repurpose parent modules for other ICPs once datasets secured

##### Business Risks & Challenges
- Strict anti-chatbot stance limits familiar UX pathways
- Data gaps for non-parent ICPs; reliance on external stakeholders (Arthur, Joe) for data
- Tight 14 Aug deadline; scope creep possible
- Quality control of AI-generated graphics; performance variability complaints noted on social media (Tim reference)

##### Competitive Landscape
- Paul building similar AI-generated full websites (SEO, blogs) ‚Äì indirect competition / knowledge source
- Generic chatbot sites seen as ‚Äúpoison‚Äù per Joe; Timeback positions itself as safe alternative

##### Resource Requirements
- **Personnel:** Backend (Tim), Front-end (Reece), Possible advisor (Paul), Data access (Arthur / others)
- **Tech:** Database, AI model (O-3), charting libraries
- **Financial:** Not specified in transcript

=================================================================
RELATIONSHIP & BUSINESS READINESS
=================================================================

##### Stakeholder Assessment
- **Joe:** High influence, clear vision (no chatbot), sets deadlines
- **Arthur:** Data gatekeeper, low responsiveness; risk factor
- **Austin:** Supportive, can assist with staffing
- **Paul:** Valuable technical mentor, goodwill likely
- **Reece:** Committed to UI; synergy with Tim

##### YNG/TIM‚Äôs Performance
- Demonstrates strong strategic planning and clear task delegation
- Needs to clarify data needs for other ICPs sooner
- Proactively arranging stakeholder engagement (Paul, Joe)

##### Decision-Making Dynamics
- **Joe** holds final say on product direction and deadlines
- **Tim & Reece** coordinate implementation details
- **Arthur** controls data flow; bottleneck risk

=================================================================
BUSINESS FOLLOW-UP & NEXT STEPS
=================================================================

###### Information Gaps
- Exact datasets and desired outcomes for other ICPs
- Confirmation from Joe on scope expected by 1 Aug vs 14 Aug
- Paul‚Äôs existing tech stack and lessons learned

###### Proposed Next Steps
1. Tim completes DB build and uploads cleaned parent dataset (within 24 hrs)
2. Reece prototypes at least two interactive modules and demo flow (tonight)
3. Group chat with Paul for technical guidance (ASAP)
4. Tim drafts question list & schedules sync with Joe to confirm milestone expectations and obtain additional datasets
5. Identify and document data owners for each remaining ICP

###### Timeline & Milestones
- **24 Jul PM** ‚Äì Backend prototype + initial modules
- **31 Jul** ‚Äì Parent MVP functional; eligible for bounty
- **7 Aug** ‚Äì Guides meeting; internal showcase
- **14 Aug** ‚Äì Production launch to parent email list
