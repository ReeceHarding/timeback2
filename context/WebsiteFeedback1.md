Yeah. Or too high tech that it's, you know, I want to be a software site, but back to being approachable and things like this, you know, it's. We already have the negative connotation of AI tutor. And I don't want to reinforce these are terminator robots. Yeah. 
Right. Everybody hears AI every mom, this is the target audience for this website that we're the hardest user is the monessori mom. 
the super tech forward person's gonna come and be like, okay, this is the greatest thing I ever read. So I don't really have to appeal to them because they're already sold.. 
Right? They're gonna read the content. Even if they don't like the design or whatever, they'll be like, fine. 
But the montossori mom's going to come in and she's not going to read the fucking content that much. She's just going to look at it and think the vibes are right, a little scary. You know, yeah, and she's thinking, you know, Terminator robots. 
Okay. Right? Yeah. 
And that's why everybody always defaults to pictures of kids and family. And I'm like, I, it's still a product- oriented site, but I want to angle it for that. I'm not trying to get them 
We looked at another website today that I a really nice same like tech forward vibe where it has like.cause you said you also wanted an animations in there. Yeah. And so's a good thing. 
By animations, were you thinking of stuff, like, as you scroll, you see, like, the page kind of changes like? The reason I wanted to use animations is back to we're trying to create explainers. Right? 
We're trying to create explainers for people. And so an animation that's like one teacher in front of a classroom to 30 at different levels, right, or something versus 30 kids getting individualized personized plan. Is there a way we can pay an animation that would just visualize that? 
Okay. Right, as a useful educ of the parent where they're like, hmm, do you understand, like, every kid is getting the exact same material versus different kids getting exact, you know, different grade level material. And is there a way, you know, animation is usually, like, if you go to the two-hour learning website, there's that animation. that was done a couple years ago now. 
But there's a team of animators who created a bunch of visualizations in it, and I'm like, oh, I wonder if I can just, you can just like prompt it up. Yeah. With Gronk. 

Right? But do you like, like this clean type of look? For when you do create a website? 
Because this is kind of a little similar to what Apple has. Yeah. So it is this something you want to go off of with you start creating arts? 
Because this also, like, when you click on this, it takes you to a new site, which I like, because I think with our current website, you look to a lot to get to actually getting the emails into so that. So maybe that's not the most efficient to keep someone on our safe if it's too much to read and look at. Correct. 
So. um what about just back to the thing? You can have a menu up top? I don't know. 

Yeah, so we could move the menu on top so there would be like 30 times. We would have what is time back on our mainlining stage and then maybe we' have the learning signs part of it and like how to actually like sign up what the the data are results testimonials things like that on different side. so people actually want to take a look at that if they can. But it's not the first thing you see. 
No one wants to see a research paper. It's in what they get on a website, right? That takes them away from it. 
Exactly. Exactly. What time is that the time back website, it's or this interest form that's going to be used just for the podcast. 
Or is it something? Yeah, then we can and then we can develop over time. Right? 
There's two different things, which is.. The website's too confusing now, right? Yeah.'s it is. 
And so what I'm like is, let's just get a landing page equivalent, is what we're building, so that we have something for Monday. Yeah. And then say, okay, how can we itate? 
What else can we add to that landing page? That's that we think is super valuable and holic. And so let's go through the other parts, I guess, which is what is the back to we have the landing page you get in it, you're like, "Oh, it's a real company, there's this thing called Timeb.. 
And it says, "Coming in 2026, your kid can crush academics in only two hours a day. Give me your email. It's got a cool logo, right? 
You're like, oh, okay, this is real, and it's coming. Right? One if you are coming and trying to? 
Yes, and we want to say it's coming in 2026, just a piece before that. Yeah, because I don't have to answer questions for four months. until it's all done or not. It's better to beat the dates. 
Do your like this school with broken your or do you want something? I Yeah, the your kid can crush academics in two hours a day, and only two hours a day is actually the message you want, not that school is broken and fixed it. It's at The message, the takeaways we want with time back.. is not school is broken. 
School is a bundle of products that's 10 different things. Socialization, life skills, your teachers, after school sports. The mommy circle. 
So time back doesn't fix any of that. It just fixed the academics. It is literally the academic engine. 
It is this the learning engine, it teaches your kid 10 times faster, they can crush academics in two hours a day, right? That's the part you want to focus on. The school part is, you can go to the alpha site, or the sports Academy site, you know, but we are just the product that is tying back is gives their kids their time back because kids learn 10 times faster. 
Learning just got you And so that that logo, that's why I like the first one where it's like time back, learning just got schooled is the. Right? That's the the logo, basically.. 
And so. And I don't know, like we have. So what are we trying to put on the page? 
You're trying to say. So where you click on the link, you get taken to the site, you have time back learning just got schooled. Yep. 
Not in massive thing, just a small right above in the center. below that, you have crush academics and tours, you help kids do that. And then you have an email. Give us your email or something like that. 
And then at the bottom the 2026 coming in 2026. Great. Let's get that. 
Okay. And then.. Coming in 26 is at the bottom. 
Yeah,. And then.. Do you want time back students, like, anything else in there, or just that? 
What would be something you'd recommend that? That you kicking fresh academics in ch today? Yeah, other than that, but about, like, what time back is itself or no. 
Like, any stat from Tuara's learning, like, any result in there, or no? I. Um.Cause we have the stuff that says over 90% hard kids say they love school, they score in the 99% nationally. You to love school once again is that love school is not the commitment of time back. 
It's the commitment of Alpha school, right? Um. Now our kids score the 99 percentile is. 
Yeah. But. I am covering the performance with you crush academics. 
Okay. Right. So, obviously. 
Which everybody in their head is gonna be like, "W that mean?" And then I'm like, "R, we'll click here for results or something, and go deeper. But just very simple, clean. 
What is the takeaway, the tagline we want everybody in the whole world to say? Your kid can crush academics in two hours a day. Like, if there was one if everybody said that, they'd never send their food to normal school. 
Right, right. So you're filming the podcast on Monday, and then it's. Yeah, I don't know when it' live, I. I want him. 
I want Patrick to be like, "Oh, okay. Yeah, have something there. I can link it in the notes or something like that. 
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. 
So, after we get there email, do you want people to see anything else or no? Right now, no. Okay. 
So let's talk about once we have that landing page. Yeah. Which we'll have in five minutes. 
What is the next thing you want to communicate to? The story of, like, what, like, the signs behind it,'cause now people know you can crush academics and touristy, but like, how do you do it? Okay. 
Like, you have to link it to the next question people ask.. Right? So that, I guess, comes in with signs, but you don't want to get too deep into signs before you tell people you' actual results. say, this is try and trust it. 
We've proved it. Here's ourselves. So what do you want as the button they click, like back to the landing page? 
You want to click proof? Like, you to see the proof or something you to like, yeah, do you want to have like like up top on the menu bar? Do you want menu bar that's like proof? 
Yeah. Yeah. Can you click on it and So this obviously would know like aesthetic design that like something like this. 
Only instead of just, only. Okay. here, I get a picture of that. The chairs. 
I feel like you would look nicer. that was.. If this is just one line. Yeah, and smaller. 
And try back. You want time back to be smaller. Yeah, I don't want time back to be. 
So I you see how we have this? Yeah. And like, you see that size, it would be that big. school is broken, we fixed instead of that, we place your kid can crush academics in just two hours a day. 
You're saying you want the logo to be this? I want the not like this, but I'm saying this size. The types of the logo. 
Like, it's not too big. Yeah. Because right now it's like in your face big, right? 
So you should make it smaller. And then your kid can crush school in only two hours a day, the same size as this, and then below that we have. Just email and. 
And then we have coming in 2026 at the bottom. Like, remember the way had it yesterday when we do that. So we're putting this is this part, though, then it's not all going to fit on the line. 
Which, your cake in perfect academics only two hours per day. Yeah. It could do B too. 
Like, that would be fine. Your cake can fresh academics in only two hours per day. Can it be crush academics in two hours a day, or does it have to be your kid? 
Can crush. Give me the wording the inside. Your kid can crush academics in only two hours a day versus crush academics in two hours a day., it needs to be. 
Okay, specifically targeted, too. They get it, it're a kid. Okay.C I't it's not so it's stupid. least to your parent. 
Okay. Bye. EZero's getting mad at me for using up on my friends. 
Anyways, and so we have a menu bar with proof that goes into the results. And so what is the results you're gonna show? The stats of Tuar's learning that we currently have on the website itself that existing website. 
The paper, we have a lot of stats in there. We have all of this bug. these. And these are all officially from our learning website, but if you have something more recent,. 
We shouldn't use. You should use two five. You said 24. two. 
You're too precise. Okay. Um. 
Average student achievement. Is that actually accur? Correct. 
Everything that we've got is from the official to our learning websites. Do you say class achievement or student. Class. 
And it says they're a student, I think. Okay. There's a class, which is different. 
Yeah... We also have the Bronzeville stats. Yeah. 
Do you want us to include that, or a little bit? Dude, it's a small sampleample size, so. I mean, it's true, but it's just not. 
Okay. It's too small a sample size to... And then we have all these different headings with clams that to our learning makes, and then the stats of it. 
Do you want us to remove these or keep some of these? We'd obviously make it look more clean and not have it be this wordy. Where are these from? 
White paper. We've also linked it at the bottom. Those are fake names. 
Yes. Keyboard in the pack. That's actually not right. 
It's all right. This is all students, this is the top two thirds, and this is the top 20%. you're making them distinct, subrange their mouth, or overlapping groups. Okay. 
This is on the This is top two thirds. This is.. That's all students. 
That's the average of all students. It's 2.2. It's not the bottom 20%. 
It's the average of all the students. And then the other one's the top two thirds of students and the top 20% of students. The reason we broke that there is in our first year, we couldn't get everybody. 
We could only get the top two thirds of people in the first. Or six months.. to 2x. Yeah. 
And I was explaining to the parents, I'm like, wee got two. Look, I got two thirds of the kids to fucking 2x. So we get the rest of them by the end of the year. 
Just relax. And then we did, but the December map test, we only had half, we only have two-thirds of them. So So do you want these? 
Yeah, yeah, those are good. Okay. And then we have these. 
I'm not sure if you'd like us to include this. It's on the current website, too. Yeah. 
It feels very numb and vague. Yeah, it's just, it's, all these numbers, I prefer a cohesive story, right? Yes. 
Mm. So I Kate is writing a substack this weekend, on our academic results. And I wonder if we're just take everything off that page. 
I see what she hasn't finished. Did you guys ever see the two hour presentation I made? Two and a half hour presentation, app? 
No, no, I haven't. It's.. Yeah, and then coming in 246 per. 
The very bottom, yeah. Well, like, still visit you.. Do you need. 
There's the, there. There's Here, let me airdrop this to you guys.. Yeah, in the air drop, see. 
This can be one that you can, though.. Under. You should include this under the.. 
Somewhere around the learning side. Or it's not proof as much as explanation. It's a two and a half hour video of all the parents. 
You want the whole video in there? It can just be a link for parents if you really want to go deep, there's two and a half hour. Can we do clips? 
And then. And if you want to clip them, you can clip whatever you want out of it.Cause we saw on your existing website, there's a 21 minute video of Mackenzie. Yeah. way too long, so we clipped smaller versions of. 
Smaller logo. I feel like we put this too small, and it feels detached. It just goes too close up. 
Like, most common friends like that after that should be in the bottom. I don't want it to be. Also, can we make time up? 
Like, can you blur it? blur it? Not blur. 
What I mean is remove the background. Yeah. And then can you make the Do you like black as the background or no?'
s high. Here, read this and see if this has the kind of content too wall. put in it. This is from Austin Scholar Subtack, and so if you clip out in your data that you want, I feel like this is nice because it's. 
That is the current, you know what I mean? It's the most current data that we have. Everything we've had is 2023 to 2024. 
I like this too. Oh, but this is out. It's not. 
Yeah. The mother this is out. But, I mean, we can just put, like, link it say, like, a school that uses. 
This is all alpha specific, so are we saying that this is are we saying in the timeback website or alpha students have achieve this? Because we're not saying time back how to a school that uses time back have achieved. We're what we need to say is our messaging on timeback is time back is the software platform that Alpha used to get. 
Okay. Actually, one word our narrative is going to be we carved out time back from alpha. Okay. 
Oh, okay, yeah. Right. So, I take that., yeah. 
Yeah, this would be useful if you could send it to us. We could pull from this, because it also has a recent information. Everything we have in here is 2023 to 24. 
Yeah. Okay, here. And so, like, in here, they actually have a the file of the aggregate map results in here to be. 
You should read the thing, like, they literally have one where they're like, she's like, upload the file to chat UPT and give it these proms. Yeah. We want the user, We want time back to be the same thing because the numbers are so unbelievable. 
You need them to like ask your school to give you their math results. Now, no school will do it because they all suck. And so no one will give it to them, even fals and the country won't. 
And that makes every parent suspicious. They're like, well, why won't you show them? Alphaets, and no one else does. 
And so we're, so we want that kind of, if you read through it, that's sort of the theme we want. Okay. Okay. 
Like We want full transparency. in numbers around group, because even the vegetables in the country will not do it. Yeah. And if you read some of the quotes, from AI, it's AI's like, yeah, all these instals are worse. 
Oh, it has the morning sounds. The blue. One of the magics that everybody doesn't understand what they are, since you' reads the entire internet, and then can consolidate data that hasn't been done before. 
So it reads like forest Man's math results, but that was just in isolated thing. Right. But then when I ask about Horst Mann, it pulls it into my answer.. 
So even though Horace Mann never published it,. He's able to get it in. AI knows more than anything. 
Yeah. like stuck with, like hard numbers too, it's nice. Yeah. Anything that says, like, we are. 
And so when you look at this, I'll send it when she manishes it. But you want to read through it as a preendure a first time reader of what is it that's really? That draws your attention, yeah. 
My problem is now, like, like achievement doesn't matter. Like, parents all think achievement is what matters, but achievements, just what you know. Yeah. 
You shouldn't send your kids to a school with high achievement. You can send your skill to a school at high growth. Yeah. 
But no one doesn't. Right. And so Soway, you can look at this and we can see what parts of it you want to take all of it or whatever. 
When it's finished. But She's putting it out this weekend? Okay. 
Uh. Okay, so we're gonna have proof for that. Proof. 
And then.. And then ideally, people are going to ask, nowow, how does it work? Right? 
Because we haven't yet talked about how to our learning actually works. We've just talked about what it is and the results we get from it. So now we dwell into learning science. 
And I think this should be, you click on a button, it takes you to a new page, so you have all the learning science in one specific area, because not everyone is necessarily interested. So there's, in the thing we just read for the substack, there's a lot of different learning science principles. Do you want us to include all or just. 
No, we need to top problem with this. There's too much stuff. We need to take out 80% of them, right? 
We want this site to be lean, mean. Yeah. Right. 
Because I know you mentioned call kind of low theory to us last time. And Blooms would also be important to include. Yeah. 
So other than that, I feel like those are the two big ones. and, like, personalized tutoring that comes from mastery and this and that. Yeah. Um. 
So in the work, Chloe that was in the effort? Yeah, if you pull that up, Yes. the product one.. technology time. I think it's. 
Nope, that was.. Garrett thinks that with there. Do you want me to pull it up from oh, let's say, yeah. 
I like how you say I'm not a design guy. Where I am wasn't you see, was a. Also, when it comes to learning signs, your effort, you've had a prompt that explains it to a monessary mom. 
Do you want us to also kind of tell a story with learning science and taking personal use cases, like making it not just this is the science, but actually creating a story within it? Yeah, yeah, we want we need examples what you need for each element of learning science. So here's what for personalized learning plans, you need the story that says, imagine, you can't read. 
Right. You're in seventh grade, and you can look up the stats, but something like 50% of fucking America in some schools, not in some school districts, 50% can't read in the seventh grade. Imagine the seventh grade teacher is doing their job.. 
They're handing out seventh grade material. Yeah. 50% of the class can't read it. Yeah. 
How do you solve that problem again only with Timeback solves that problem. Because back to the put kids in the right level, right? It will give them, if you need first grade phonics, it will put you in a first grade phonics lesson. 
Sure. In that story, right, is what you want to express for personalized lesson thing. You want a second one, you know, for each one, your kids behind. 
You could have one of COVID. They missed multiplication tables in COVID, but they're an eighth grade, and they're struggling.. Time back will recognize that and give them third grade. 
Multlication agents. Do you think parents respond well to their kids's being told they're're supposed to be learning third grade stuff when they are in eighth grade? Or that something. 
No, that's a very controversial point. Like parents hate them. Yeah. 
But they all agree with that the kid can't read. You should teach them to read. Yeah. 
And you have to word one where, you know, I guess there's wording to fix. I can fix the wording because I've had enough parent conferences. Yeah. 
You know, if you tell them. The key to algebra is fractions. And so if you haven't mastered fractions, you don't do well nowhere. 
So all these kids are like, oh, I'm not a math person because I didn't do alcora. It's just because they raced through fractions and missed it with COVID, always through COVID and everybody like, okay. And you're, you missed it during COVID. 
And then you just go back and clean it up, right? Refresh it, you know? And then parents are like, oh, okay, that makes sense. 
Right? Or this one, you have a seventh grader who should be working at ninth grade. Yeah. 
We'll give him ninth grade material. So here's this is one also, this part is what is important. Back on a product site. 
Do you want to get for sure?. And that's in the. That's in the time back. 
You have linked too. But this is your tech DF.. The differentiators versus everybody else's, which is. 
Let me make sure I have them all right. I' wrote this a long time ago. It's the only AI coach that watches student ride coaching on how to use the apps correctly. 
So no other app, no con, no math Academy.. synthesis. Nobody watches the kid using the app and coaches them. Like, you're screwing around, kid or you're guessing or you're skipping, you're scrolling the question. 
You're scrolling the reading and guessing on the questions or you're not using the app correctly. Okay. And so we use the AI vision model that's our big use of AL. 
So the part that we want to have on the section on AI is that everybody thinks AI is a chat bot, a Socratic tubor.. And we think that as poison. Yeah. 
Right? That whole pitch. And so in the two things you want to use in AI for is to generate personalized lesson planning at whatever level you, fourth grade, first grade, seventh grade, whatever. 
And then second, we use the vision model to watch the screen and coach the kid, but not academically coaching, coaching a man to use the app correctly. Everybody thinks everybody's like, everybody's not planned to, right? Plan two people need us crowd two. 
Right? 90% of the world needs to be told stop dicking around.. Right? 
That's why I tech doesn't work. Con Academy works for 10% of the people. Right? 
And the C 10% of kids who are all self motivated, who want to go crush it, and the people right at tech are all the top 10% people. Yeah. And if you run to school, though, your folks start the 90%. 
Right. And the 90% of the people are like, stop dicking around. Yeah. 
That's why time b is so valuable is because you're giving those 90% something they want to go dick around the rest of the day. And so you're like, go focus for two hours, so I'll give you the rest of the day. Anyway, watching the screen and coaching them, nobody does that. 
Number two.. Just to be very, sorry to interrupt. Go ahead. 
It's. When you say watching the screen, you're tracking, like cursor movements and clicks, but you're not, like, watching the kid through.. You okay? 
Yeah. We have both. Okay. 
We have both. Because if you're spinning in your chair.. Right, we also do sentiment analysis of the. 
Yeah. Now, in our schools, we activate everything because you're in school where I can do anything. When you go home, I turn off a webcam. 
I, because I was going to say that seems. I don't want to go dystopian, right? If we're. 
Well, watching your screen is dystopian too and people. It's a little bit less when it's like a kid's face, though, right?. It's a little bit more dystopian, if it's a kid's face being watched by like a tight. 
It's actually interesting because the psychology behind this is really hard to deal with, which is parents are like, if it fucking gets my kid to learn, you really, interesting. Now, at school, like, it's really fine at school. When they go home because they're in the thing, they're like, oh, I don't want the camera seeing something in my house or whatever. 
Right. So they want it off. You have to turn it on actually for proctery, because 40% of parents cheat for their kids. 
Yeah. Like, it's insane. Like, I'm like, how do you expect your kid to learn when you go answer the question? 
I'm like, first of all, you just fuck the AI out, because now its your kids knows all this stuff. And. And so, but anyway, so we there are times even at home, where if you want to do a house. 
You have to turn it on because cheating's so rampant. But in the school, it's considered totally fine. Okay. 
There's all these privacy issues around. thing. Like for us, we have it sometimes with like exams when they're online, when it's like, you have to like opt it to like, yes, turn on my camera, whatever. So is that like a, when you open the app button? 
Well, the parents just, if you're going to be in an Alpha school, you can just blanket consent. Basically, got this. Right, because I need it. 
Yeah. No, that's one of our issues with homeschool. Yeah. 
Is, because we need back to how important it is. The problem is not, it's that the kids are dicking around. And so you need to watch the screen. 
Like, the number one feature I put in two years ago was, no parents believe that their kids dumb or their kids not, not that they're dumb, that they're not engaged. Yeah. They're like, no, my kids said he worked really hard for two hours. 
And then I had to show him the webcam. where literally the kid's not even in front of the computer for two hours. I'm like, he's not even sitting at the fucking computer, okay? So stop with your, he's working really hard. 
Yeah. Right. And once I had a video clip and proof to the parent, then they'd be like, okay, Junior, what's wrong with you? 
Yeah. And so a lot of what you're doing is enforcement, and so it is dystopian. And, but that's what you need to do to get the results.. 
This App Store for Educational App, So we're building, it's not but it's going to be part of it, which is we're going to be the only app store that's built for educational apps that gives you money back guarantee if your kid doesn't learn. Oh, wow. Right. 
So we're trying to to mandate all educational labs, right? They all don't work. Yeah. 
And I want to just create a brand. It's like, you don't have to pay unless your kid's test scores go. Okay. 
And so like all our apps are like that. Like we give a GT school if you don't get a 15,00 SAT by the eighth grade, we give your all your money back. And so we want to create that as just back to as a thing, so we're going to have an app Store that way. 
Is it kind of like the time back that the students at Alpha using now? Because we had to look at one of the students's computers where they had like all their different courses and apps.. That is going to look very different, but. 
Okay, yeah. But fundamentally, yes, there's gonna be all these different apps in the app store that you can use. Okay. 
Like, part of what we' I'm going to get Sulcon to put Con in it. Now it's free. I'm it back to your T. Only mastery level. 
This one's another big. It's the only mastery level assessment platm. No one else enforces master. 
Not one app. Kah doesn't have C doesn't synthesis doesn't. Nobody, even the best apps. don't enforce mastery and bacteria blooms to Sigma. 
Everybody when they read Bloom's to Sigma, attached to the AI tutor half of the paper, but that's one Sigma. The second Sigma is mast. Right. 
And it's very hard for people to enforce mastery because the kids have to grind through mastery. It's hard. I guess not a lot of people like the idea of having to do something repetitively over if they don't. 
They hate it. Yeah. Right. 
But it's what works. And so, a lot of what we do in our pilatform, learning sciences like this is what works, Parents and teachers who've decided, I don't like that.. So they don't do it, and then the kids don't learn. and you're like, "Well, you just have to decide. 
You want to learn, do this way or not? Yeah.. Yeah, yeah, yeah proctoring the cheating, which really matters now with AI.. 
We are the only one who we're the only out, who prove tests itself against theized tasks. Like, when you finish Con, it's like, oh,'re lesson's done. I'm like, like, or any online out. 
You're like, you're done." And I'm like, well, it says who? And you're like, "W, the guy who wrote the act. 
I'm like, shouldn't there be like a third party this is you're done? And that's what we use as star test or M test or SAT test or an AP test. We use some standardized tests that proves you learned it. 
Yeah. And that's what we're putting in this app store, which is part of the platform, which is, if you sell something that says they learned fourth grade match, then at the end of it, they got to cr a fourth grade standardized fourth grade math that. Do you have like official collaborations with them? 
The tests? Yeah. No, we just use. 
They all the state test stuff is... It's public.. Now. 
APN SAT, you have to go do a physical building. map test, we do use online. have an online version we use. Once again, Proctered, though.. Government reimbursement systems, so we're hooked into ESEAs and stuff like that, so that you can get reimbursed for it. motivational reward system, all of our motivation systems. 
What is the thinking behind that? Motivation? Yeah, like motivating kids with.. 
Money, Games. Free time, screen time. Just whatever gets them. 
Emporium, whatever it takes.. You should Austin scholar as a subst actually wrote last week, and this whole astral codex, it's a big one, is people who do well, your average plan two kid is high IQ, high conscientiousness, right? Which is relatively, and both of those are intrinsic traits. 
And so that covers your top 10% of people. The other 90% are missing one of those other two. They're either not high IQ, or they're low conscientious system. 
IQ, by putting kids in personalized lesson plans, we can guarantee everybody through the eighth grade can be top 10%, no matter how low your IQ is. And the problem is, in most schools, is once you get behind, you can't catch up, but our system lets you catch up, and you put the time. And so we solved the IQ problem with personalized lesson. solving the conscientiousness problem, we solved with our motivation. 
Yeah. And the question is, there's a whole, the top 10 percent of people are always like, love of learning that you will destroy intrinsic motivation. that's not really true. Right. 
That's actually empirically not true, which is how many people who are trying to get a 16600 SAT are doing it because they love the subject, the esoteric grammar rule they're learning. Or is it' because I want 16600, which is 100% extrins of motivation? Tom Brady, like I had a long talk with Tom Brady about this. 
Because Tom Brady is seen as the ultimate intrinsically motivated from football, right? I want to be the world's best at football is like, I want to win the championship. I want to be one. 
That's all extrinsic motivation. Yeah. And so there's this great paper that's been written that says, there is no such thing as intrinsic motivation. 
We believe it's a complicated answer. Our internal view of the parents don't like that answer either, so we don't quite say it that way, is we will use money to do one of two things if it will change your daily habits because if you change someone's daily habits, like get them to do two hours a day, you'll change their life trajectory. And it's worth, it's worth it. 
We will also use money if it changes your intrinsic view of yourself. So a lot of education is all these bottom 90% kids have hang ups on what they can do. Like, I'm not a math girl. 
I'm not a science girl. I can't be tough 1%. I'm not a GT kid. 
Whatever it is, yeah. And if I can pay somebody $1,000 and convince them they're top 1%, by getting them there, because I pay them to do the work, and now they're top 1%, and they wake up and they're like, oh, I guess I am smart, whatever that means. Right? 
It's worth $1,000. We spend 20 grand a year on this in per year in education. at public schools, we should totally spend $1,000 dollars bribing kids to become top 1%.. The second one, the other place we bbe is to go fill holes. 
No one likes to go back. Yes. And so I created a scheme where I went to the seventh graders and they had all these holes, and so they couldn't they had no mastery in any way. 
And so I went and I was like, look, guys. I'll give you 100 bucks if you get 100" I said, you guys could get $100 on the Texas star. And they're like, no, we can." 
I'm like, I'll give you $100 for $100. I'll give you $100 bill for $100. They're like, "We still can't." 
I'm like, "No, there's a catch. any grade level." They're like, "We can take a kindergarten one, you'll give me a 100 bucks. I'm like, " Texas Star starts on the third, third grade, yeah. 
So they went and took a third grade test, got $100, and then they did a fourth grade test and got $100 and then got a fifth grade test and got an 85, because they had holes. And I was like,D you want the AI to generate the personalized lesson for those last 15 points? They said, "Let me see how many it is." 
They're like, "Wow, I can do that in a week.." And then they did it, got 100." And so literally for $400, you can take most kids in America and get them two things. 
You can fill their holes and convince them they can get 100 on any standardized test. And I'm like, it's totally worth that. We should totally spend $400 to motivate kids to do it. 
And if it took $1,000, you'd do it, right?Cause it changes kids' internal, one, their capability by filling the holes, and second, their internal belief, where 95% of kids at alpha believe they can get 100 on a ton of stock. Fewer than 10% of their parents think they can get 100, because in the old world, standard school, only the GT kids got hundreds. 
Yeah. Right? We get more hundreds in our spyglass building than school districts of 100,000. 
Because we've convinced everybody we've shown them. Here's how you get a hundred. Right. 
And that, all using whatever motivation a model I have to. to get them. Now, money's one way, but guides, that's why we spend, you know, working $100,000 for every guy whose entire job is to figure out, because a kindergarten actually doesn't care about money, really, right? They want stickers and they want recognition, they want free time, you know, the Astro Codex one is long in an important way, which is time back is the most important motivator. 
Not money. So if you told me, I have choice A and choice B, which is, you can take the Westlake track six hours a day, four hours a day of homework. Right? 
And you can pay those kids. Right. Thousands of dollars. 
Yeah. Or you can take those kids and say, you only have to do two hours a day in our system and get to do Alpha X projects, your passion project all afternoon. Yeah. 
The Alpha X passion Project, all afternoon is a bigger motivator than thousands of dollars if you you don't have the time back. Yeah. Time back is the reason we call the time back and not, like, paying money is because giving kids their time back is a bigger motivator than money is. 
Even though Ed, the guy who wrote the article, thinks it's money, it's not. And but every kid's different, right? And. 
And for some kids, it is money, for sure. But And as you get older, money becomes more and stuff. But we don't care what the motivation is. 
It's our job is to get the results. And just like a coach of a football team, like coach's not how you. Yeah, it doesn't matter.. 
You're filling a kid's head with knowledge, right, is worth. I mean, we obviously society think it's worth a quarter million dollars per kid, 12 years, 20 grand a kid. a year. We think it's worth a quarter million dollars. 
And I'm like, okay, how many thousand of that, 10,000, thousand a year? Yeah. Right? 
You have to give 100,000 of,50,000 to the kid. Yeah. That seems like a totally fine tradeoff. 
And there is no proof that it destroys intrinsic motivation or love of one.. And so, anyway, but it's a taboo. Yeah. 
Right. Which is great. Because no copy us. 
Um.'Cause at the end of the day, you're like, what do you care about more? Results? 
Your kid crushing academic results or having to pay. And at the end of the day, every parent says, I don't want him paid, but when they see the academic results, they change your mind.. The X ray, we have the best deep report on what your kid knows and doesn't know, that no one has. 
That's for the parents? Yeah.. And the kids, too, right? 
Yes, that's. That's one of those things like parent teacher conferences are like the most useless shit in the world. You have no idea. 
Like, oh, we love having Susie in her class. She's such a joy to be there. I mean, it's a waste. 
And grades are wasted. They mean nothing. Yeah. 
Right. That's why we do give no grades. Right? 
Until high school we have to for a transcript and we just make those up. We literally are just like, whatever. Everybody gets an A plus or something. 
And then. Yeah, blah, blah. LLMs that doesn't matter much. 
Open scridge, yeah. It's built on one at 10. That'll land. 
That matters for a big, we're gonna get all the. We're getting the Stanford and Harv. We're getting the Ivy League to endorse time back as the educational data repository to do research. 
Okay. Because they all want the data that's in time back.. For kids applying to college.. 
They want it for just learning science research. Okay 'Cause they all have schools of education about all these learning science groups, and they want to do educational research, all their PhDs want to access the data. So the dean of Stanford can be burning scienceience Guy, the president of Dorman says. 
And so and right now, public schools won't give the data out because I don't want to struggle that day right. And so we are publishing. And when the Fortnite game comes out, it'll be put in all the data for a billion kids around the planet. into the timeback platform. 
And so it'll be the largest source of data around the world of how fast and what works and what doesn't work. Like how important is mastery or how important it is personalized lesson play and or space repetition or cognitive load theory. So we'll have all that data. 
So, how much of this do you want us to include? And so for this, the one around you know, over it's one of those things as we look out over time, we're going to want to put all of this. in there, we're going to want to reflect this in there. Yeah. 
And some will just have coming soon. They're not there yet. Sh But this is your differentiator of these are the key parts that no one else has. 
So when you think of learning software, we have to add this was before the AI one, where we have to explain how it's not how checkouts are bad, and vision models. personalized learning plansans. We have those two things there, what we don't have is that chapots are bad. Okay.. 
Is there a way to connect them in a sense of saying, this is what makes odds different, and then at the same time, also talk about, why we're doing it this way in some sense? Yeah, no, exactly. And that's what we we need to go through each one of why it's important, I mean. 
You sort of have to have feature benefit and what is why does it does mastery matter? Sure, right? Yeah. 
Nobody thinks masterering that also, but it really does.. Do we have the page? Yeah, so here is one idea. 
This is a little bit more, like bright. Um same idea, but like. Also, we can change. wise. 
Yeah. I would prefer it to be, like, this just on this would be two lines. Like, you're kicking crush academics in only two hours per day. 
What do you think, though? I still feel like the time back is too big. You still think it's It's not feeling like a logo. 
It's supposed to be a logo, right? Or is it more of a. brand placement thing? I feel like it gets like. 
Like, is this our official time back local? Yeah, I am, what do I think? When I look at this, it's gonna be.. 
Well, let's how much do you want to shrink it by like, 75%? Is that that go? So shrink it by 75 and let's look at them. 
Let's just do it quick, little route here. Is there another local incove mine? Is there a local you have in mine, like a symbol or something? 
Or no? There, you, you know, on the, on page 23 or whatever, they're using that. The two dots and the. 
Yeah. Is this smaller? smaller? 
Even smaller? Yeah. Go to decide she likes, then we can look at it. 
It's a little smaller. It's 75% of this, or? Uh, like, maybe 60.. 
And do you want it to be completely different than to ours learning? Like, right now, they have blue and white. It's all the colors. 
Okay. Yeah. We're gonna have to do a version. 
We can do two version of pages, one in the color scheme for Mackenzie. Mm. McKenzie cares about I could give a about myself. 
McKenzie. It's important. I understand. 
I just, I have no expertise in it. And so I'm like, somebody else has to worry about it. But she really cares. 
So, we'll. Better? Yes. 
You could make it a little bigger. if that's what you're thinking, but I. No, I'm focusing on this now. No, you do not. You pressure. 
I' mix and only. Yeah. What do you think about for this, Do we need? 
coming in 2026? Bigger? I want to move it all the way to the bottom, and I want to put it in all caps. 
And.. Can I make it animated? Oh, like a banner type of? 
Like it's coming, like the letters like coming in formed it out. Yeah, yeah. It's just coming in 2026 and just a loop of coming in 20 so all caps. 
Okay. Coming in 2026, yeah. Yeah.. 
Are you flying to New York for the podcast, or are you. Sunday night. Yep. 
You want it to, like? Like, push into the screen or, like, appear on the screen from its current position?. Like, okay. 
Like, you just wear a C currently is, you just start there, and you just type it out. Okay. It doesn't need to move across the whole screen because it's really short.. 
What was it? Okay, what you said the coming in 20 something, what was the other thing that you wanted to... All caps? 
All caps. Yeah. And then just have it tied up. 
Yes. And bigger was it supposed to be bigger or no? Just all caps. 
So you said it's not actually coming out in 2026? I'm trying to give it out. Well, we're going live. on August 10th at Alpha. 
Okay. Better be. If the teams are working like a 100 hour weekends where we're it does not work today, like other demos today not work. 
But we have one month to give it to work, and then based on that, based on how good it is, Our schools are protected if there's buds, it doesn't matter. But for broad distribution.. 2026 is safe, but we we'll do a beta in October and November of the people. I don't know how to get it to replay the animation, but it did the animation. 
Maybe publish.. Or like, there's a way to review.ustrate.. So, is it a score or is it all day? 
Per day, A day. Mmm, I like it. Okay.. 
So, this would be with the animation of text. Can we coming in 2026 loop or no? Is that part? 
I keep going. Like, continue. Just continually reyping. 
So there's just activity on the pave, that's all this. Or can we animate the two hours a day? Maybe that's that seems to give me. animate it in what sense? 
Like, like it's like flashing at you or something. It's. That sounds too gimmick. 
Yeah. Too gimmicky. But the coming in 2026.. 
So the apple page has this like where you do needs analysis. Yeah. Right? 
Where you're like, oh, I want to look for work. And then we Right. I like how the button, like, moves every time. 
So is this what you envision the form being like when we do make one? For like? I prefer if it was less. 
I hate... five questions as like app in the ass. It seems like, um... Like, how do I get out? 
See, now I'm stuck in it. I hate this, right? You gotta keep going back. 
And then where? Where do I go? Well, that's it. 
Well, how do I? stuck on the page? Are you looking at the Apple website? 
Yeah. I gotta go here, I go back here. Okay, that's nice. 
Okay, definitely. And now we'll. pauseuses for two seconds and then I repeat this. Hmm. 
It doesn't need to, like, type back. Is it possible for it to just disappear and then type again? I' not. 
I like the idea. I I don't know, I kind of like that there's so many there left over. Yeah. 
That's. Okay. So now the coming in 2026 runs. 
It what? Like, it runs continuously. Great. 
Cool. We can change it to not type backwards if that. Yeah, you can just. 
It's better to just delete it and then just only positive typing. Yeah. And then delete and positive typing. 
And so can we do two versions of that? Can we do this one? And then we need to do one with the colors from design firm and I will give McKenzie sign off. 
Can we pick our two favorite colors? Because she's attached. I think they have multiple in here. 
Yeah, yeah. I think the hair on the. I don'ly don't mind this. 
I like the blue. I think the blue we need to keep. I think the blue would go well with the yellow. 
Okay. There's a picture on here somewhere of the blue and yellow together. What? 
I thought, when we looked the room, I be wrong. I also don't mind the.. The blue and the orange look nice. 
Oh, wait, here, look at this. Actually, the light.. Like, big. 
Yeah, like, the text could be that, and the background could be or the other way around. The text could be blue in the background could be th. See if that works. 
I think. Because any of these combinations, I... Like, see, look at these two. 
I think I look at better with the blue background. Yeah. than the. Yeah, that works. 
Okay. Are you able to do that now, or. I mean, I can just pay for it.. 
I don't know. Senator.. Okay, so going back to like, what's the most important on the website to do next. 
So proof. So hopefully, we have proof, we'll have Kate's substack. Yes. 
And that'll give us a bunch of stuff. And here's, I guess, when I think of it, it really is a you know, when you come to the website, you want to be these results seem unbelievable. Right. 
Right? And here's, you know, it's carved the narrative is we've carved them out of alpha. Here's Alpha's literally level, just like on the, she's gonna have it on the substand.. 
Here's the scores. Upload this. You can download it and put it into your own chat GPT and get your local school to give it to you. 
Like, create a little fake off. on the website, right? Where it's like uploads your data here. Oh, nice. 
And you know, to compare. Okay. And um But where are these kids getting their data from? 
Well, they should go. Parents should ask their school. Okay. 
Now they're never going to say that they're never going to give it to them? Yeah. But creating that demand is. 
Yeah, you just all of a sudden, and then it's like, and if it's not, then just hear some, have it where they can have some sample prompts that they can use when they upload it to their own a.. Because they're all skeptical. I'm like, look, here's the bio ofloadedi and ask it. 
So like, like, compare this to the best schools in the country, right? Or what's the worst part about this? Right? 
You know, and you could have some different proms there that would make it interactive where, you know, when people back to active learning, when they do things, they believe it more than reading it. Yeah. And so you get them engaged where, I mean, if you get them to write, download the file and upload it to their own CVT, right? 
And highlight that their school won't give it to them. Yeah. Right. 
You now own that person because they don't trust their school. Yeah. Right. 
And then they're highly skeptical. And then you know, so there's a proof part, then you say, what are the learning sciences part? Yes. 
And the learning science part very much is mastery learning, Bloom's Sigma Paper, which is both mastery and individualized lesson plan, and you help describe it, right? Yes. What is, you know, what is have AI sit and say, explain this to a monessori mom? 
Yeah. You know, in an example, she would understand for her five-year old, right? Or you know, we' Bill, make the website interactive with AI. 
Okay. Right. Is it possible when we talk about you wanting to have people be able to upload their schools, scores, and compare it, since most people probably won't actually either get the data or go through the trouble of doing it is it possible for us to pull actual data. 
I mean, I don't know how we'll get it. I show them be like, oh, you can't access it. So we can we can't pull it from school'c that's not accessible. 
But you can get here that might be that's an interesting question, which is, let me ask this, let me answer three. Okay.. Give me the. 
I think it's too harsh. It needs to be all the way down, ands But then it's it's gonna look weird if this is all the way down, but then there's the top. Okay. 
Like, the border is like, when it deles, should it fade out a little bit more? Because it just like goes. Can you make it, like, one piny bit smaller size? 
Why does it need to be smaller? Okay. So I just asked it. 
Right. So just ask it? Yeah. 
Okay. And I's gonna say, you know, I can't give you exactly, but generally it can it'll generalize your answer. So, yeah, that would be a good one. 
Which is if they don't have it, we can have a, I guess it. Because I feel like we should be able to recognize that people won't have access to that., won't. And all you're trying to do by asking for it is not the comparison. their thought in their head. 
It's just like, it creates suspicion. So like Trinity here in town is the best K through8 sort of pre-alpha. It's the best one. 
They refuse to give their kids standardized tests because their math is so bad. And so like, we had a parent, we had two kids, a sixth grader and a fourth grader, and they told their teacher, they're like, oh, I'm going over to Alpha,'cause they're doing maps testing, and my parents want to see, since you don't do it here. And literally, the teacher stopped the class and went down to the principal and brought the two kids. 
Right? And then the principal called the parent is like, thathat's really bad. You should not let them take standardized tasks. 
And that's really bad for them, right? Because standardized tests are terrible. And the parent of a sudden was like, you're supposed to have the best. 
My daughter's supposed to be the number two math student in this school.. Why do you not want her to take a math this task? Yeah. 
And it create all the suspicion, and then he took the math test and that kid fucking dumb Or just, you know, poor achieving, poor achievement. And so he moved into Al. he's like, oh my God. And then he told all the other St. 
Stephen's or Trinity parents, holy cow, they're math It's at Trinity is terrible. That Right? And as soon as you don't get it, it wasn't it was the fact that they were defensive about it, which causes the.. 
That makes people think. Distrust. Right. you to the ham.. 
So with the prompt Sorry, what do you want from the prompts? I know it's supposed to be interactive. You want. 
What are the prompts, if you're a parent? Yeah. What prompts do you want to ask about academics? 
That's gonna convince you that Alpha's been? I mean, our goal is alphabet, but that's going to eliminate your skepticism. Okay. 
Right? What are those problems that you sit there and you're like, you know, compare it to my school? Yeah. 
How about that? Right? Is one way. 
You know, when you read Kate's thing, she's like, compare it to the best schools in the country, and then you read that, and then you're like, well, what are the negative parts? Yeah. Yeah. 
Right. And you want them to interrogate the data. And so what is that right? 
That would be a good pain. That'd be an exciting proof page, right? So the negative things about alpha, what are we think? 
You just got to say yeah. Okay. Look at these results. 
Yeah. What's the worst thing? And like, it'll say things like, it's middle school is not as good as it's kindergarten through first grade, but it's the middle school is still better than every other school in the country. 
Yeah. And you like, okay, I'm fine with that negative. Yeah. 
Right. Should we include stuff about, like, college or no. like, admissions, things like that? Do you guys. is our weakest part because we have so few graduates. 
Yeah. But we use to just Hitch on SAT and Okay... I mean, we have on the website some of the college stuff that we can use, but mostly we're folks on K through82, which versus high school. 
God, really, what if we decide the blue and which one to be one of you? This the green, yeah. Do you think the cream background blue touched? 
Yeah. Wait, I think it's gonna look too playful if we full blue background with. Oh, yeah. 
Where was that? It was farther down. this one or this one? I like this one. 
Or do you like this one? I don't know. I'm looking nowly with the little cream. 
Yeah, I don't cream. I don't It looks nicer with the point. I don't think the blue. 
Not with the orange either? Where's the blue with the orange? Um, I mean, here as well as.. 
I don't mind it. I think that looks nice. But not this blue, the dark blue. 
No, I mean, the dark blue, like the dark blue with orange text orange with. Right? Here's an example of what we're trying to get, which is. 
Right, my prompt was just compare Trinity. Right.. And then it goes through, and it gives you, you know, the AI, gives you these answers, you know, and then the bottom, it gives you, you know, oh, Trinity's a more established school, but I don't know, whatever last night it says. 
Yeah. Right. Where parents are like, oh, okay, Right? 
They understand where're trade off. Okay. Right. 
Is this focusing too much on alpha? 'Cause I'm I'm just trying to keep time back in mind, and I'm trying to understand where we're different. For the first year, It's I'm back is. 
Okay. And then. Because I don't have any other, I mean, we have GT school, which can do more crazy on the record. 
I don' results. So. So we should, I mean, and then when Texas Sports Academy gets going in a year, we'll have more, it just we don't have enough. 
Okay, yeah. Yeah. Orange with the blue. 
What do you got? We're thinking for Mackenzie's colors, we're gonna do this orange with this dark blue. You've have an opinion. 
Like, at all? Even if it's not an expertise opinion, you don't have an opinion at all.iter. There's things I care about. 
Design is design, I a little too. I'm trying to think of it with. That's what I'm saying.. 
I think, okay, try this first, see how this works. Okay. Background with blue and texture cream. 
Okay, now, after Proms, what would you. Yeah, what do you think the next important part is? Probably, what we've covered what timeback is, the proof, the signs. 
We've now jumped into the data that we're getting from K Substack. We've now have an interactive piece where people can finally realize, oh, wow, my school is shit. Alpha, maybe move. 
Now it's about how do I make the move? Yes, and so so that other part, where that first part where we're doing ideal customer profiles, basically, who are you? Yes. 
Where do you want to put that? How do we want to design that? This is for the parents. 
So this is you at parents, which is homeschool, right? The categories were parents wasre homeschool after school for find a time back school. Yeah. 
And then there was, I am a school, Public or private. Yeah. Right? 
All that v category. Did you have that on the website? We do. 
We have.. This is what it looks like we do find your path to learning better, and then we have, I want time back from my school, and then we continue, and then you just fill out the form. If you're a parent.. 
And then you just, I guess, select which one. If I want to start time back my own time back, so that would be the entrepreneur for a country, that would be government. Supp support, that would be philanthropists. 
So and this would be bringing time back to your school. Yeah, this is, I prefer if this was. We could definitely make it look cleaner. 
Yeah, make it look cleaner. Yeah, we will make it look nicer and have it. I mean and you do want to say, I'm a parent. 
Yeah. Okay. And then I want a classic because I want to know if you're a parent or a school or a philanthropist, right? 
I need you to classify yourself, not just the needs. Sure. And we'll make. 
So S, we have. What are you using? Love. 
Say that we have these almost like bubbles. parent government philanthrops, whatever, say you select parent. Then you have the three options of homeschool. I want to enroll my kid in. 
A time back school. Or you want to find a. Or after school. 
Yeah, those are your three. It's's find a time back school. Yeah. 
And enroll sorry. No enroll. Find a time back school. 
Yeah. homeschool or after school. Right. Those are your three. 
Okay. The three choices for a parent. I think it's in that outline. 
Yeah. Those are the three. Okay. 
And then, from there, once they selected, Dewey, Ben Taylor, the questions based off of what they've selected? Because the questions would be different, right? What questions do I have? 
I just.. Well, if you want to bring time back to your school.. Oh, I need to know. 
You need to know where they are. Yeah, okay, correct. Things like that. 
Correct. So, and if it's... After school, well, no, at that point, we have their email, so we could just reach out. 
Okay. And then I'm getting the same goes for, like, government. You literally just need to know what country. 
Yeah. Okay. Right. 
Just You can give him a text, it's just for. Yeah. Okay, we can make this look cleaner.
