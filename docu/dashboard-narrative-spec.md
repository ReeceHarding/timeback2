# Dashboard Narrative Specification

This document outlines the strategic vision for the personalized dashboard content for each Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). The goal is to evolve the dashboard from a simple results page into a "Vision Alignment" tool that makes the user a believer in the TimeBack philosophy.

## The 5-Block Narrative Framework

The dashboard will guide the user through a persuasive narrative in five sequential blocks:

1.  **The Empathetic Hook:** Acknowledge and reframe the user's stated problem in deeper, emotional terms to build immediate trust and show we understand their true motivation.
2.  **The Radical Proof:** Present hard, data-driven evidence that we can solve their problem. This is typically a dynamic chart showing a clear, compelling "before and after" scenario.
3.  **The "How It Works" Differentiator:** Explain the core TimeBack philosophy (Learning Science, Mastery Learning, etc.) to differentiate our method from generic competitors and "AI shortcuts."
4.  **The Vision of "Time Back":** Connect the practical results to the deeper emotional payoff. Show the user the life their child, students, or community can have with the time and opportunities recovered.
5.  **The Clear Next Step:** Provide a specific, low-friction, value-oriented call to action that logically follows the narrative and keeps the user engaged in our ecosystem.
