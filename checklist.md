## âœ… Work Completed

### 1. Strategy & Planning (`/docs`)
- **High-Level Strategy:** A comprehensive strategic brainlift was created and refined in `docs/tbwebsitebrainlift.md`.
- **Detailed Specifications:** We have created a full suite of technical and product specifications:
  - `docs/journey-spec.md`: Defines the end-to-end user flow, including return visitor logic.
  - `docs/content-schema.md`: Specifies the metadata structure for all dynamic content.
  - `docs/api-contract.md`: Details the endpoints, payloads, and error handling for the back-end.
  - `docs/llm-eval.md`: Outlines the LLM provider choice (Groq) and fail-over plan.
  - `docs/frontend-plan.md`: Provides a blueprint for the front-end architecture.
  - `docs/analytics-spec.md`: Defines the event schema and A/B testing framework.
  - `docs/security-checklist.md`: Lists MVP security and compliance requirements.
  - `docs/sprint-roadmap.md`: Maps out the work required for the July 31st and August 7th deadlines.

### 2. Front-End Demo (`/mockup`)
- **Parent ICP Flow:** A high-fidelity, interactive front-end demo has been built for the complete Parent journey.
- **Landing Page:**
  - Fully styled with approved branding, colors, and typography.
  - Features a blurred hero image background and a prominent TimeBack logo.
  - Implements a progressive disclosure form: email is entered first, which then reveals the ICP selection cards.
  - Includes a "Featured In" section with media logos for social proof.
- **Quiz Page:**
  - Maintains visual consistency with the landing page (background, logo).
  - Presents a two-step, animated questionnaire inside a polished "floating card" UI.
  - Includes a "Back" button for improved user control.
- **Component Structure:**
  - All pages and components (`Landing`, `Quiz`, `Dash`, `ComingSoon`) are in place.
  - A `ParentContext` manages state with `sessionStorage` for persistence.
  - A `BlockRenderer` is ready to display dynamic content on the dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The front-end demo is complete. The next phase is to build the back-end services and connect the two, turning the demo into a dynamic, data-driven application.

### 1. Back-End Implementation
- **Build API Endpoints:** Implement the `/session/start`, `/personalize`, and `/profile` endpoints as defined in `docs/api-contract.md`.
- **Database & Content:**
  - Set up a database to store user emails and profiles.
  - Create the initial set of content assets (as Markdown files with YAML front-matter) based on `docs/content-schema.md`.
- **LLM Integration:**
  - Implement the `llmClient` wrapper.
  - Integrate the primary provider (Groq) to power the personalization logic.
  - Wire up the fail-over provider (Together AI).

### 2. Front-End Integration
- **Connect to Live API:** Replace the mock data in `Dash.tsx` and the form handlers in `Landing.tsx` with live calls to the new back-end.
- **Implement Analytics:** Integrate the PostHog SDK and fire the events defined in `docs/analytics-spec.md`.

### 3. Content & Expansion
- **Build Other ICP Flows:** Once the Parent flow is fully functional, build out the quiz questions and dashboard content for the remaining four ICPs (School Leader, Entrepreneur, etc.).
- **Content Population:** Begin populating the `/content` directory with real case studies, testimonials, and data charts.
